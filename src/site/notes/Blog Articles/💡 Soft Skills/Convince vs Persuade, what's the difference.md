While convince deals with your mind and your rationality 🧠, persuade focuses on your emotions and the resulting action 🚜. In my humble opinion, and maybe because the power of persuasion is more significant than the conviction's, persuading someone is much more complex.  
  
For example, in 2022, I think it is useless to convince anyone on the importance of sustainability and its challenges 💧🌳. However, whom amount us is actually persuaded and act in consequences? And if so, how did you manage to put your relations in action?  
  
I believe that, even if it sounds incredible hard to take this move, there is actually a simple way in 3 very basic steps, and that we, at AVEVA, have seen it live for the past 30+ years at the #AVEVAPIWorld Conferences. This is about identification, pedagogy and accompaniment:  
  
1. 🕵️‍♂️ Identification to people who share the same (or very similar) stories, either via their works, industries or even only the challenges they overcame.  
  
2. 🎓 Pedagogy by learning tools, solutions or products which helped them fix their pains and achieved their goals.  
  
3. And 3. 💪 Accompaniment by sealing this first two items with trust that we built in the whole ecosphere of customers, products and partners.  
  
And thanks to the incredible event team and all the participants, AVEVA has managed to reboot the event, 3 years after the previous one, and as successful as it used to be 🎉  
    
AVEVA PI World 2022 is now over, but fortunately, all the stories will be soon available online. So if you've missed it or you're willing to watch some replays, you may find the link of the recordings in the comments.  
  
So enjoy, and let's make our planet great again 🌎!
