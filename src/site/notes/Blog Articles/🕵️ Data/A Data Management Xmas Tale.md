I love stories, especially those echoing from the past! May it my passion for the PI System that reflects on me? Who could tell...

On this uniquely special Christmas day, let me share one close to my heart. A tale gifted to us by my colleague and dear friend, Roberto Serrano, to whom I owe more than he realizes.

Lo, this chronicle unfolds in the bygone days of data management. Come, let's embark to the teeming streets of London.

🤢 **Cholera's Deadly Grip 💔**

Picture this: it's 1854. the city is once again immersed in a dense fog. However, this year, for the past few months, the city has been gripped by a deadly epidemic: cholera. Its residents live in fear, unaware of an impending revolution in public health.

👨‍⚕️ **John Snow, The Maverick Healer 📊**

At that time, widespread panic concerning the epidemic, coupled with a lack of understanding of the disease, fueled the notion that maladies float in the air, like a haunting wind trapped within the thick London fog.

In the heart of this crisis stands John Snow, a visionary physician armed with a highly unusual tool for his time: data. He emerged from the mist and began asking questions that no one was wondering before him. His mission? To unravel the mystery behind the deadly grip of cholera that held the city in its clutches. He examined numerous maps and pieces of information, and eventually discovered something truly alarming: the sickness was originating from the Broad Street pump.

To Snow, the pump was the root cause. He had the handle removed, and that brought about a significant change in halting the spread of cholera. Unfortunately, because of his status and his unconventional methods, the society didn't deliver him the recognition he deserved until ten years after his passing.

📚 **A multi lessons story** 🎓

This tale is not only highlighting the perseverance of our hero, but also showcases how the data (and in particular by crossing historical & spatial data within the analysis) has led to a major change of paradigm. Indeed, from this point forward, water could also be considered the bad guy, not longer solely the air, as commonly believed! 

In our tale, John Snow, not an esteemed epidemiologist but a hero nonetheless, untangled the threads of one of the biggest diseases. Here are the few outcomes of his story:

📢 **Every Voice Matters:** Like his, every voice holds potential. Let's listen closely.

🌹 **Recognition Now, Not Later:** John's brilliance shone posthumously. Don't wait to celebrate brilliance; do it now.

💡 **People with Data can Transform their World:** We believe in the transformative power of data. Equip your experts, unravel mysteries, and paint a brighter future.
