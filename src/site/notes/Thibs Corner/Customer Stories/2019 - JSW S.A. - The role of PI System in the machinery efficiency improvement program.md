## Description
Monitoring systems of machines and mining equipment are the essential elements of the effective management of the mine, because they affect the safe operation and increase equipment efficiency. We will talk about how the PI System helps us solve problems related to the specificity of machines in the mine such as production processes move with new coal discovery. Therefore, the workplaces appear and disappear and machines like mining equipment, power supply and ventilation have to change location. We will present challenges that we were facing to obtain good quality data with different types of SCADA systems in many localization without unified vision and how we came up with a holistic view of the entire enterprise and publish the results of analysis to the right people at the right time as KPI and OEE. We will also discuss about the automation transfer into ERP system of process and downtimes events.
