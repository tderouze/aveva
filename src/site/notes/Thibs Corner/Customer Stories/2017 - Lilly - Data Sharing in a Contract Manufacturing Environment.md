## Description
Currently, Eli Lilly does not have access to real-time data from the contract manufacturers (CM) in their Device Manufacturing group. They rely on the CM to provide reports and/or ad-hoc data. Utilizing Asset Analytics, Event Frames and OSIsoft Cloud Services, Eli Lilly executed a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to implement a PI System at a Contract Manufacturing site. PI Cloud Connect allowed Lilly to remotely monitor assets on a discrete manufacturing line. This PoC proved to enable an array of benefits, including standardized “Production Monitoring” calculations, categorization of various downtimes, automation of manual reports generated by the CM, compliance (batch reporting) and comparison of machine performance across multiple contract manufacturers, such as machines producing the same parts. Eli Lilly is now working through development and rollout strategies to implement this approach at a number of their contract manufacturers.
