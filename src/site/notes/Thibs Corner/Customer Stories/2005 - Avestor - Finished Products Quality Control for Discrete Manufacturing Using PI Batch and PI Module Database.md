## Description
AVESTOR designs and produces batteries that use a lithium polymer technology. This type of technology allows the storage of a large quantity of energy in a battery that is five times lighter and three times smaller than the equivalent acid-liquid technology. The final manufacturing step is the battery cycling (floating, discharge, charge, floating) which is automatically controlled using a Control Logix PLC, and where the data is acquired using the PI RtPM. The PI Batch and PI MDB subsystems allow data collection according to the battery’s serial number. The resulting system allows quick data search, reporting the cycling data in order to certify the battery and interfacing data/battery statuses to the ERP system. This presentation covers the project’s various technical aspects as well as the resulting benefits.
