## Description
CEPS is a Czech transmission system operator (TSO), which has been running the PI System since 2013. This presentation shares how CEPS integrated the PI System into its existing TSO infrastructure, namely with Microsoft SQL Server, and expanded the current data warehouse coverage for fast data (such as synchrophasor measurement). With complex infrastructure, the creation of transparent interfaces between customers and data warehouse is crucial. CEPS describes how it was able to perform this task while complying with strict safety regulations and availability criteria put on systems running in a dispatch control environment. This presentation also shows current applications of visualization of synchrophasor data from the PI System along with data from other systems in the dispatch control room using PI ProcessBook, Load frequency control (LFC) evaluation and analytics, and future employment of the PI System for fast data aggregation and usage in GIS.
