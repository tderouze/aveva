## Description
In 2011, EDF and its partners Fluxys and Total decided to build a new LNG terminal in France in Dunkirk: DUNKERQUE LNG. The construction site represents an investment of â‚¬1 billion in the terminal alone. The structures being built will be among the largest in Europe: LNG tanks with a capacity of 190,000 m3, a 5 km tunnel carrying warm water from the nuclear plant nearby to the terminal and a pier capable of accommodating "Qmax" methane tankers with a capacity of 266,000 m3. Dunkerque LNG through its O&M subsidiary GAZ-OPALE, aims at a high level of operational excellence : high safety and environmental commitments, regulatory performance, combined with high-burden assets, and need to meet aggressive project delivery schedule in the short term. A real-time data infrastructure is to be a core component to address these key area of focus, including facilitating commissioning and ramp-up. The presentation will introduce key aspects of the DUNKERQUE LNG and challenges of LNG operations, and outline the plan for using the PI System.
