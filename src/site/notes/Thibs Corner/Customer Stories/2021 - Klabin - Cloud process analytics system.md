## Description
With the arrival of the fourth industrial revolution, digital transformation and data migration to cloud computing bring new challenges and solutions for the industrial segment. In the "Process Analytics" project, it was possible at first to organize the process data in the PI System Asset Framework tree, unify several databases and add value with an almost real-time system using microservices architecture with all data stored in the cloud. An analysis that would need to manually collect data from different sources and could take hours to complete can now be done in just a few minutes using this system. Graphical analysis tools, statistics and machine learning algorithms make this project an important data analytics tool for us, with better process analysis and decision making.
