## Description
In this presentation, Unilever-Kilbourn in Chicago will present the tangible value they have received in deploying a PI System with the Asset Framework to reduce waste, improve packaging OEE, and integrate diverse data sources and data consumers in a standards-based approach. This presentation will show the value of the system for the site and will take a forward look into Unilever’s research on OSIsoft’s Cloud Service (OCS), in collaboration with OSIsoft’s Lighthouse program. A discussion of the ability to leverage the valuable context built for the site into the cloud to serve enterprise needs in an robust and cost-effective approach will conclude the presentation.
