## Description
The Luminant Power Optimization Center (POC) is a 24x7 fleet-level diagnostic and performance support facility serving the Luminant generating fleet including nuclear, coal and gas-fired facilities. The POC is fueled by plant data received over a corporate wide OSIsoft PI System platform. Incoming PI System data is processed through various applications, advanced statistical models and performance calculations to identify anomalies. The POC compliments normal control room monitoring by analyzing minor changes in machine dynamics and efficiencies in real-time as they are experienced. When an abnormal condition is identified and warranted attention, the POC collaborates with plant staff. This approach enables plant operators to take preemptive measures to engage in troubleshooting, remove equipment from service when necessary or prepare other contingency actions sometimes well in advance of potential challenges. This presentation provides an overview of the Power Optimization Center, examples of improvements to fleet operations and offers a perspective on how the internet of things will bring about radical transformation of the electric utility industry in this age of "Big Data."
