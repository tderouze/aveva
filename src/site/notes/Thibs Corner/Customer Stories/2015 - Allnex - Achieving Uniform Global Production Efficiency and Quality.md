## Description
This presentation describes the success story of Allnex, a global, chemical enterprise and long-term customer of OSIsoft. Allnex has implemented OSIsoft's PI System at multiple sites and is using the product effectively for the company's Efficiency and Quality programs. A future roll-out will increase system usage to several global sites in Europe, Asia and the US.

This global quality approach using applications based on existing PI System functionality will be the primary topic of the presentation. Specifically the presentation will describe the implementation of new PI Systems at sites in Germany, Norway and Japan in 2014 and 2015. As part of a global quality initiative, Allnex and SpiraTec jointly managed the planning, procurement, installation, configuration and development of the PI System for the three plants.

In addition to implementation of PI System modules and the configuration of various interfaces to DCS systems, Allnex and SpiraTec developed several applications using the Asset Framework, Event Frames, PI ACE, PI ProcessBook and PI DataLink. These applications include: Golden Batch Analysis, OEE, Energy Management, Preventive Maintenance and Alarm Management.

A global approach at Allnex ensures that all new PI Systems work well with existing ones. SpiraTec enforces this through standardized hardware and configuration schemes at all international sites. Data created by the different systems can therefore be horizontally and vertically exchanged and compared. "
