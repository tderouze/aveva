## Description
From a financial perspective, an operational perspective and because it is the right thing to do, it makes sense to use energy as efficiently as possible. Sustainable Energy Management is the key to efficient utilization of this scarce, and expensive, resource. The focus is shifting away from a project based approach to energy management towards a system based approach to energy management. While energy efficiency improvement projects are an essential component of an energy management program, they are not, in themselves, sustainable. There is a step change in efficiency as soon as a project is completed, but efficiency starts to drop off again over time if the systems to support energy efficiency are not there. Energy management should be self-sustaining, something that is done by all employees on a day to day basis and not just project based. New Goldâ€™s New Afton Mine has realized this and is actively doing something about it. The new ISO 50001 Energy Management System was launched in June 2011. It is a systems based approach to energy management and New Afton mine saw this as the vehicle for integrating continual energy performance improvement across all functional areas of the organization. Starting in late 2012, New Afton was the first mine in Canada to start implementation of the ISO 50001 system. As measurement forms the foundation of any Energy Management System, in late 2012, New Afton implemented a PI based Real Time Energy Management Information System (RtEMIS). This is a product of RtTech Software, ADM Systems Engineering (Dartmouth, NB) was the integrator and Indel Control Services (Ingersoll, ON) managed the infra-structure. A comprehensive network of 120 electrical sub-meters, 6 gas meters and a data concentrator was established to hand off data to the OSIsoft PI system in place at the mine. RtEMIS processes this data to provide energy cost reporting, energy intensity analysis by cost center, track energy performance against baselines for operational performance targets and track the impact of energy efficiency improvements. The project, from planning to completion took only 6 months. Using ISO 50001, RtEMIS and PI data, New Afton hope to achieve a 5% to 8% annual reduction in energy costs This presentation serves to outline the implementation of the RtEMIS and the ISO 50001 EnMS at New Afton Mine, the challenges faced and to share the benefits realized thus far.
