## Description
Presentation shows more than 20 years of PI system usage in steel industry. The main part is focused to automation of blast furnace and maintenance processes. The platform of realisation are : - interfaces between MES and Process automation levels - optimisation of material consumption - prediction of production parameters - preventive maintenance support - maintenance plans calculation The application of PI system brings savings of costs for maintenance, increase reliability of production parameters and increase quality level of final products
