## Description
Uniper started its 3-year Digitization journey in 2016. A major element of the program is the consistent and harmonized introduction of the OSIsoft PI System for our asset fleet. Now, 2/3 through the program, Uniper leverages the central availability of machine data to optimize its maintenance CAPEX budget and reduced it by 16% for 2019.
