## Description
> Tyson needed operational visibility to understand its Jimmy Dean sausage plant
> Producing over 150m lbs of sausage annually, meat is packaged into 1lb rolls—weight must be as close as possible without being under
> Fat % and meat temp can affect flow rate, which results in variances
> Anything under must be cut open and reincorporated, over is considered ‘giveaway’ product
> Using the PI System, Tyson tagged 11 lines of timed clipping machines to understand flow rates in real-time
> Previously, a person would manually check every 15 minutes
> By seeing weight by line, uptime % and the number of sausage ‘chubs’ produced, the data showed that the target weight setting was too close to 1lb, resulting in too many packages being underweight. It was actually more efficient to raise the target waste to lower rework and waste

> The cooking line received a deviation from the USDA, so they had to shut the entire line down for two full weeks to ensure that the process controls were in place to allow for safe cooking
> Process testing costs approximately $50k and the average food recall costs $30m, so it was important to manage testing costs while getting the line back up quickly and safely
> Using the PI System, they analyzed four temperature zones in the ovens and noticed a temp drop in zone 1. Data showed issues with the modulated steam valve that controlled humidity and that issue correlated with a recipe change that increased cooking temps by 50 degrees
> The steam valve wasn’t able to keep up with the temperature increase, so they changed the recipes again and the process came back under control

> Tyson has seen overall yield improvement of 0.1 percent in the first six months in the Jimmy Dean sausage facility – those savings paid for project 
> They reduced waste and giveaway within that same facility by increasing amount of meat in package and automating their quality assurance reports which saved them eight working hours per day, freeing up employees to perform more impactful tasks
> The corn dog facility was able to cut waste in half, saving them about a million pounds of production. 
> Real-time process alerts and the ability to set recipe verifications means that Tyson can avoid food recalls and protect the brand

-------------------------------------------------------

**Challenge:**
- Product waste and giveaway on the Jimmy Dean sausage line
- Cooking line deviation from USDA shut down sausage operations for two weeks 

**Solution:**
- Using the PI System, gained the visibility to correct and automate rework and waste, and adjusted the recipe to correct cooking temperature

**Benefits:**
- Improved overall yield by 0.1%, achieving 6-month ROI
- Reduced waste and giveaway by 50%
- Saved 8 worker hours per day
- Real-time process alerts help prevent food recalls, potentially avoiding $30 million in recall costs
