## Description
The Hanford Tank and Waste Treatment and Immobilzation plant, also known as the Vit Plant, is designed to process and stabilize millions of gallons of radioactive and chemical waste. With required nuclear rigor and two equal but completely separate control system networks, the Vit Plant turned to AVEVA PI System and Waterfall software to provide data historian capabilities, network redundancy and a secure system to transfer the data from the two control systems to the production network. Learn how Waterfall s unidirectional gateway paired with AVEVA PI System provides the required security to protect the Vit Plant s control systems and data while meeting necessary cybersecurity requirements.
