## Description
Producing elastomer is not easy. It requires more than 2000 regulators and 7 process areas, separated by buffer equipment; in addition, to producing it at a high quality management standard (Michelin Business Model), producing 24/24. Michelin has to produce their products under these conditions and abide by their business model. Across all of its plants, Michelin has rolled-out the MQP program (""Management Quotidien de la Performance""), a Lean/Sigma corporate initiative, geared towards productivity, process efficiency, and quality and utilities management. Michelin are implementing 2 levers:

- A value analysis of what are the minimum / most efficient process parameter to follow.
- Real-time monitoring of these parameter.

To automate and streamline the MQP visual management dashboards, Michelin Synthetic Rubber plants have leveraged the PI System Infrastructure across its units (in France and US), consolidating sensor-based data to continuously create information that operators can use to act upon."
