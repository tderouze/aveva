## Description
Employing about 6,000 people, ArcelorMittal Ostrava a.s. is the largest steelmaker in the Czech Republic and part of the world's largest steel and mining group ArcelorMittal. It has an annual production capacity of 3 million tonnes of steel and exports roughly 50% of its products to more than 40 countries around the world.  
  
ArcelorMittal Ostrava first installed the PI System at a single blast furnace 20 years ago. Operators used PI ProcessBook, PI DataLink and the PI Interface for ODBC installed on two independent OpenVMS servers (VAX 3100).  
  
Now, ArcelorMittal's PI System has expanded to connect data from all the Ostrava plants including blast furnaces, coke and steelmaking plants and rolling mills. The planned tag count is about 20,000 and the new implementation is rolled out as single HA instance.  
  
At its wire rod mill, the main role of the PI System is visualization of process data and quick analysis of production parameters (rolling speeds, for example) and comparison with operational limits, KPIs and statistical values. To get the system up and running, the first tasks have been to design the asset structure and data connection of the wire rod mill using the Asset Framework. Current tag number is about 500 and includes MES L1, L2 and L3 data. The asset structure has 4 levels and more than 150 nodes.  
  
Different parts of the organization contribute to the PI System deployment. To visualize data, process engineers design PI ProcessBook screens and PI Coresight environments. MES and IT departments playing supporting role - defining and maintain asset structures, frames and analysis library, setting up connectivity and system maintenance.
