## Description
Old Dominion Electric Cooperative generates power from a mixed fleet of natural gas, coal, nuclear, and renewable facilities some operated by partners. In 2015, ODEC's VP of Operations challenged the IT Department to develop a unified view of all facilities that could be accessed anytime, anywhere. Based on prior experience with the PI System, ODEC initiated a project to determine if an updated and expanded PI System could meet this need. After conducting a successful proof-of-concept workshop, ODEC signed an Enterprise Agreement with OSIsoft in December 2015, and within six months, the ODEC team, working with their EA support team, redesigned and deployed their PI System architecture, initiated data collection from their partner operated facilities, and developed Electra, a portal and dashboard that meets the needs of all ODEC departments. Come listen as the ODEC PI System team describes how they were able to accomplish so much in a limited time with only a few part time resources allocated to the project.
