We achieve this by combining the client's domain knowledge and operational data with our know-how to achieve immediate results. Our technology is the result of many years of application and continuous development of our AEI (Artificial Energy Intelligence) based software, process and energy expertise, deployment of very accurate and cost effective energy monitoring hardware and the ability to connect to and use existing systems.
