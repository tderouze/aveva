## Description
Effective Leakage Management involves the automated monitoring of flows and pressures in the clean water distribution system, to check for anomalies (a sudden unusual drop in pressure or increase in flow at a meter, or chain of meters, may indicate a leak) and to bring such events promptly to the attention of the relevant staff. Reacting to increasing pressure in recent years to reach set regulatory leakage targets, Yorkshire Water launched the “RTNet project”, which is focused on utilising data from an expanded deployment of flow and pressure loggers across its network in order to provide a much more proactive identification of possible leakage conditions. This talk will review leakage challenge and performance commitments, the approach and technology using the PI System to profile leakage events and the business outcome of implementing the solution.
