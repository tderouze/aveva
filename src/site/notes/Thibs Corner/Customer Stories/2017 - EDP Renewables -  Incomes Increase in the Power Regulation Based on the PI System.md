## Description
Energias de Portugal (EDP) is presenting the actions taken to adjust business after new REE (Spanish TSO) requirements in terms of Power Regulation and the new commercial restrictions model by the use of the PI System. Starting from an obsolete application and energy losses in the curtailments (proportionally applied to nominal power and not to expected power) together with a non-user friendly environment and manual operations usage, EDP will present the actions and results obtained after the use of a new optimized algorithm including all wind farm restrictions and setpoints. This new algorithm built in an AF/Analytics and PI ACE environment with several protocols implemented from/to the PI System for automation (ICCP with Block5, PI2PI, OPC etc.) resulted in a non-attended system with operator supervision, a user-friendly system with alerting notifications and most important of all, an income increase. Finally, EDP will talk about the importance of the EA agreement inside this strategy, the new global architecture design and the PI Integrator for Business Analytics usage.
