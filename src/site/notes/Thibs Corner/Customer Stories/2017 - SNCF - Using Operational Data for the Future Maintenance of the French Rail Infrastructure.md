## Description
SNCF RÉSEAU (NETWORK), an SNCF Group Business Unit, manages, maintains and develops the French rail network. SNCF RÉSEAU embarked on an organization-wide modernization and digitization program to increase the utilization availability of its assets, better plan maintenance and investments. Those evolutions aim to address the increased ridership of one of the largest European railway infrastructure. Stéphane de Paris, Chief Data Officer, will present a new digital platform and uses-cases that leverages the PI System in order to modernize and create actionable information for the network monitoring centers and field maintenance teams. Thomas Oriol, co-founder of DATAPRED, will shed light on the assessment of Machine Learning technologies in that context.
