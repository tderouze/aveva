## Description
Prior to the PI Server 2010, Pepco Holdings Inc users would primarily analyze data with the basic PI Client tools, namely PI ProcessBook and PI DataLink. Since the implementation of PI Server 2010, PHI has made huge improvements in a user's ability to analyze EMS data. PI WebParts now gives us the ability to convert and display our EMS one line diagrams driven by PI System data. Due to the ease of PI Asset Framework (PI AF) navigation, PI Coresight has brought users to the table that have never used the PI System before. The PI AF SDK gives us the ability to query our 60,000+ daily EMS events with ease via a centralized web site. PI Coresight mobile app has brought the PI System data to our phones and tablets for fast 24 hour support.
