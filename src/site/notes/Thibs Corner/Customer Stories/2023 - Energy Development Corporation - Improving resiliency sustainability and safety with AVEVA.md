## Description
Energy Development Corporation (EDC) implemented its Natural Catastrophe Project in 2019. EDC integrated all its weather stations, slope monitoring, earthquake sensors, and other environmental devices and put it into the AVEVA PI System . AVEVA PI System correlates all the data to provide insights on how typhoons and earthquakes affect geothermal plants since these are situated in the mountains. This information is shared with local communities for their safety, and these insights inform sustainability efforts as well. Learn why EDC shares AVEVA PI Vision displays and AVEVA PI System data reports with insurance companies and how it helps EDC with HSE policy compliance.
