## Description
There will be 2 TotalEnergies presentations in the 45 minute period:

**#1 - Leveraging the AVEVA PI System for Data Governance ...Presented by Virginie Segard and Gaël Cottet**

This presentation will present how the PI System, and in particular PI AF, is being used to provide solid operational data governance as a foundational capability for a portfolio of applications across TotalEnergies.

**#2 - Leveraging the AVEVA PI System for Energy Efficiency and Emissions Monitoring... Presented by Pierre Bernadi and Gaël Cottet**

This presentation will overview how the PI System, and in particular PI AF, to support energy efficiency and emission monitoring (CO2/SO2) at the molecular level. PI AF templates containing fuels gas enthalpy are used to calculate thermal process unit energy monitoring at the molecular level for combustion.
