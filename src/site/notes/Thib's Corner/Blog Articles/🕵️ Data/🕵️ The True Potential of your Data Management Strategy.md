# 🕵️ The True Potential of your Data Management Strategy

Speaking of Historians, there's no better position for me to say that the best advice comes from ancient stories. That's why, to talk to you about data management strategy, I chose to tell you a relatively well-known story from World War II: the story of Abraham Wald. Let's dive into a compelling tale and discover the parallels that could reshape your data strategies.

🌍 **A World War II Strategy that Resonates Today**

During World War II, Abraham Wald, a brilliant mathematician, was tasked with improving the survivability of Allied bombers. The initial approach was to reinforce areas that showed the most damage upon return.

However, Wald took a different path. Instead of fortifying the damaged zones, he suggested reinforcing the areas that showed no damage. His rationale was simple yet profound - the planes that returned with damages were the ones that could endure them. The undamaged areas on the returning planes pointed to vulnerabilities, as planes hit in those spots weren't making it back.

🚀 **Applying the Lesson to Data Management**

Similarly, in Data Management, the areas that may seem untouched or not in immediate focus could be the critical points requiring attention. Entrusting this analysis to those deeply immersed in the business - your in-house experts - is akin to Wald's strategic thinking. They understand the nuances, intricacies, and specific needs of your operations far better than external applications or entities.

📈 **Takeaway: Empower the Experts Within**

As we navigate the complexities of Data Management, let's take a cue from Wald's wisdom. Instead of solely relying on external consultants or software editors for tactical decisions, let's empower your in-house Business Experts with the right tools, to fully take ownership of their data. They are the key to unlocking the full potential of your operations and steering your organizations toward resilience, growth, and sustained success. 🌟
