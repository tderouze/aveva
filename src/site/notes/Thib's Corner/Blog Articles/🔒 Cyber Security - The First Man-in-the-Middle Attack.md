# The First Man-in-the-Middle Attack

As we step into the new year, I'm thrilled to share a captivating story gifted by my brother [Geoffroy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tderouze/overlay/create-post/#), a cybersecurity expert. I've chosen this tale for two main reasons.
1. Traditionally, January is the time to embrace new resolutions. Vigilance in cybersecurity is one resolution we should promptly adopt or consistently renew.
2. And this story reveals that cybersecurity attacks don't only fit the realm of computing.

This narrative unveils the intriguing story of the first "Man-in-the-Middle," an incident that occurred 40 years before the advent of the first computer! So let's embark to the Royal Institution in London.

🛡️💥The first "Man-in-the-Middle" Attack

It's 1903. The Royal Institution buzzes with excitement. People eagerly await a demo of the wireless telegraph, the new cutting-edge device. Marconi, the inventor, is set to send a Morse code message from his Cornwall to Fleming in London (500 km away). And what's make it more unique? Marconi has been asserting for several months that it was super secure. You see it coming?

On the big day, tension fills the air. The room is packed, and everyone hushes as Fleming gets ready. Suddenly, a tapping is heard, even before the demo starts!

Before the public realizes, Fleming spots a problem. It's not the expected message! figuring it out, a word repeats, "Rats". Then, verses targeting Marconi appear: "There was a young fellow of Italy, who diddled the public quite prettily" 📢😱

Although the rest of the demo goes smoothly after a quick pause, the damage is done. Furious, Fleming writes to The Times the next day, demanding the "scientific hooligan" (the old-school term for a hacker) to confess. 

🎩✉️ Four days later, the person behind it emerges from the shadows. In a daring move, Nevil Maskelyne, a famed magician, takes credit in the same journal. No confession, just a bold claim. His motivation? Backstory alert! Marconi's past patent had stifled Maskelyne's magic shows, sparking resentment. That's why Maskelyne sets out to crush Marconi's demo by intercepting the supposedly secure communications.

And just like that, the world witnesses the birth of the first-ever Man in the Middle attack in telecom history. Magic and technology collide in a thrilling tale of revenge and disruption! 🌐🔮

By revisiting this historical event, we learn that the pursuit of innovation must be accompanied by a commitment to secure technologies. Equip yourself with knowledge about cybersecurity threats and spread awareness. Your vigilance today secures the innovations of tomorrow.
