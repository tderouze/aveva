## 2013 - EMEA Users Conference - Paris

### Compressed-Air Management with the PI System

Saint-Gobain Verallia is a French glass manufacturer that produces glass bottles and pots. One of the Verallia plants' main energy costs comes from compressed air consumption. Using the PI System as the base for a pilot project, Saint-Gobain initiated the PDH project to monitor compressed air usage in an effort to reduce energy consumption costs. This presentation discusses the PDH project and how it enabled the company to fine tune their central infrastructure strategy and decide on the right PI System client tools for their users.
