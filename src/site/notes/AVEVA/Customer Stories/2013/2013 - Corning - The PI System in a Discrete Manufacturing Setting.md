## 2013 - Regional Seminar - New York City

### The PI System in a Discrete Manufacturing Setting

This presentation will cover the use of the PI System in a discrete manufacturing environment.  Specific examples of uses in communication boards and OEE monitoring are explained.  Integration of the PI System with a maintenance management system and an example of high availability PI Servers being used to monitor and provide data to a Manufacturing Execution System that runs a production floor by using PI ACE (Advanced Computing Engine) are also explained.
