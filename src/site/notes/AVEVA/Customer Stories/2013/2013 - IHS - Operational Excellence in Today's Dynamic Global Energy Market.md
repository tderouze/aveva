### Summary
This is a keynote address from IHS at the OSIsoft User Conference in 2013, focusing on the theme of 'Operational Excellence' (OE) in the dynamic global energy market. The presentation highlights trends in energy demand and supply, emphasizing the 'unconventional revolution' driven by shale gas and tight oil. It discusses the importance of information, analytics, and industry expertise in making timely and critical decisions. OE is presented as a concept where people and machines perform perfectly, requiring a focus on both machine data (uptime, efficiency) and decision data (management systems, business processes). The presentation concludes by emphasizing the need for OE across the entire energy supply chain, from wellhead to burner tip, and how it drives returns, reputation, and shareholder value.

#### Challenges
The presentation doesn't explicitly mention AVEVA software being used to address challenges. Instead, it focuses on the broader theme of operational excellence in the energy market, the unconventional revolution, and the need for better decision-making through information, analytics and industry expertise. Challenges includes:Dynamic energy markets and potential supply interruptions, growing global energy demand, shift to challenging environments like deep water/arctic, unconventional gas production/ hydraulic fracking, risk management in energy, communication time.

#### Solution
The presentation focuses on the need for Operational Excellence (OE) in the energy sector. OE requires a combination of people, machines, and decision data working in perfect harmony. To achieve OE, organizations should focus on performance monitoring, tracking and compliance reporting, pipeline/rail integrity measures with real-time measurement, technologies to reduce emissions during fracking and real-time monitoring, real-time equipment measurement and performance management.

#### Benefits
Achieving Operational Excellence leads to increased energy independence, manufacturing renaissance, innovation in shale gas, improved speed and agility in real-time information flows and decisions, and better risk management. Additional benefits are: improved returns, reputation, brand and shareholder value. Better decisions in an OE-enabled organization, driving best practices and efficiencies, and increases visibility and performance.
