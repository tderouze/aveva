### PI System at Heineken Seville: A Base for Our Sustainability Goals

Sustainability isn't something Heineken has just started to talk about. They have been working towards better environmental and social stewardship since the business began 149 years ago. To embed and integrate sustainability is one of the company-wide strategic business priorities; it?s fundamental to how they do business.  
  
Heineken strategy focuses on areas where they can make the biggest difference: water, energy management, CO2, sourcing of raw materials and responsible consumption. For the Water and Energy Management project in one of their most advanced breweries in Europe located in Seville, Spain, they chose the PI System to help meet targets.  
  
Using the PI System, they implemented real time data tracking of sustainability performance indicators against the expected targets, receiving alerts when any indicator is outside of expected values.  
  
There is a long way to go in order to meet 2020 targets, but they are sure that with the PI System they will have more reliable results from our data processing and correlation, which will strongly support decisions needed to improve thermal, electric and fresh and waste water use in the site.

## Description
Heineken introduced a sustainability program in 2010. The targets for the Seville brewery included a 25% reduction in water consumption and 40% reduction in CO2 emission. 

Challenge: 
At first, they were able to reduce their consumption by tackling the low hanging fruit, but they quickly hit a wall, because they no longer knew where there were opportunities for improvements. They were lacking operational insight
Between 2008 and 2020, reduce brewing facility water consumption by 25% and CO2 emissions by 40%

Solution: 
They implemented a PI System. This allowed them to quickly build and deploy sustainability metrics and present their sustainability data and metrics according to department, area and equipment. Departments can now monitor and take responsibility for their water and energy consumption.
Use PI System as single source of truth for consumption data to identify non-obvious ways to reduce 
Deploy PI AF, Analytics, and Notifications for data management and PI client tools for visualization

Benefits: 
On track to meet 2020 targets 
Water, thermal and electricity efficiency improvements attained every year since PI System implementation
Cooling time reduction

---------------

Business Impacts:  Energy Efficiency

       Goal:  Find ways to reduce water use by 25% and CO2 emissions by 40% in their brewing facilities
Obstacle:  Lacking the tools to bring data together from multiple systems and properly analyze it
   Climax:  Using PI AF allowed them to collect and organize all of their data; 
                  The use of models and templates reduced the amount of work needed to manage the data, making it easy to replicate the work across sites, departments, etc…;
                  Using server-side calculations (PI Analytics, Performance Equations, Totalizers) provided access to both the data and the results of complex calculations in the client tools
   Results:  The savings identified by analyzing their current data will keep them on track for their 2020 targets;
                   The PI AF foundation can be built upon, using PI Event Frames and BI tools, to look for even more savings in future projects
 Benefits:   Examples of actual utilities and energy reductions include the following items:
                   1. lower electricity, water and thermal energy use with pasteurizers
                   2. more efficient use of compressed air
                   3. reduction in amount of cooling required

Pain Point: Sustainability & Waste Reduction
Heineken introduced a sustainability program in 2010. The targets for the Seville brewery included a 25% reduction in water consumption and 40% reduction in CO2 emission
PI AF allowed Seville to create templates with sustainability KPIs. They grouped their sustainability data and metrics according to department, area and equipment. Departments can now monitor and take responsibility for their water and energy consumption.
