## Description
Plant efficiency and reliability are extremely important to the successful operation of any nuclear units, and even more critical to those in unregulated retail markets where availability, flexibility and cost are major drivers. Exelon Nuclear has been proactively pursuing the use of real time systems such as the PI System and wireless monitoring systems to collect more real-time data (Local Conditions, Process, Equipment and Predictive), to provide that data to the various consumers of the data (Plant Engineers and Operators, PdM Analysts, Corporate Engineers) at ANY location WHENEVER they need it for use in advanced monitoring and diagnostics tools, including pattern recognition. The result has been a significant reduction in equipment related downtime. In addition, there has been a real move from time-based maintenance tasks to condition-based maintenance tasks and as a result, a reallocation of important resources to perform higher value tasks. In this presentation we will discuss the business drivers and overall vision, the systems and applications used, the results to date, the plan forward and the key success factors and lessons learned.
