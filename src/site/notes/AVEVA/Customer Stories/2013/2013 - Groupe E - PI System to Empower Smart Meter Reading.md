### Summary
A2A, the largest Italian multi-utility company, uses AVEVA (OSIsoft) PI System to address challenges in real-time asset monitoring across its hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants. They've implemented PI Vision as a single point of access for all key users (OT/IT), enabling mobile access, collaboration, and improved infrastructure reliability. The PI System integrates data from various sources, utilizes PI AF Models for data organization and analysis, and employs custom PI Vision widgets for enhanced functionality.

#### Challenges
Information is dispersed and difficult to reach. Lack of specific infrastructural alerts causes data losses.

#### Solution
Adopting PI Vision as the only web end-user interface. Business system data integration. PI Vision displays. Custom Widget for PI Vision. Data Access with right AF profile security (inside and outside the company)

#### Benefits
All end-users could access to plant data in an easy way independently of the site. Single point of access. Business model centralization. Mobile access. Collaboration analysis with PI Vision. Increase reliability of infrastructure
