Dalkia manages 163,000 installations in 27 countries. They have chosen the PI System as the data infrastructure to manage field data and measurements. These data were acquired automatically rather than a manual process and are used to analyze the site activities and behavior. 

MOS (Monitor Operate and Saves) is Dalkia’s main application to build analyses and reports. These reports are uses by energy analysts to increase site efficiency and to monitor their energy consumption.  
  
DEL (Dalkia Energy Live) is the Dalkia solution to provide a visual look at energy use and situational awareness to building occupants.  
  
Dalkia will provide insight into their roadmap for setting up their PI System. The PI System will deliver data to the provision system, invoicing, and dashboard application. The PI System is the tool chosen by Dalkia to centralize all field information.
