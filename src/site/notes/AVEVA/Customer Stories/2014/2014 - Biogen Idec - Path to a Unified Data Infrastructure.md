### Path to a Unified Data Infrastructure

This presentation will show the path Biogen has taken since moving from pre-2010 PI System to their current, unified data infrastructure.  Biogen has moved the role of the PI System from a data historian for compliance reporting and trending to a problem solving and problem-avoidance tool.  The presentation will discuss ways they used Asset Framework, ACE calculations and Web Parts in their PI Systems for cGMP, Pilot-Scale Manufacturing and Facilities.  The PI System makes scale-up from product development to manufacturing easier, monitoring facilities to provide pro-active maintenance and keep facilities in a compliant state.
