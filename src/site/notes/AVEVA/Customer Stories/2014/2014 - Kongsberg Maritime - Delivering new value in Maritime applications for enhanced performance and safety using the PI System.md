Kongsberg Maritime deliver systems for dynamic positioning and navigation, marine automation, safety management, cargo handling, subsea survey and construction, maritime simulation and training, and satellite positioning. Four years ago, Kongsberg Martime developed a centralized portal called K-IMS (Kongsberg Information Management System) which incorporated all systems in one view. K-IMS platform includes the PI System as the data infrastructure and other applications to provide Kongsberg global support, fleet office support, and offshore operations support. This talk will discuss the use of OSIsoft PI System in the following area:  
  
• Offshore Drilling Operations: Minimizing survivability risk, maximizing the drilling riser operability, monitoring in real-time well head fatigue, situational awareness of weather and adjusting work planning  
  
• Engine Performance Application: Engine status visualization and notifications when fault patterns are identified, continuous engine and subsystem diagnostics during operation, trend analysis and prognosis of engine component condition, continuous Engine Emissions Monitoring (NOx, SOx and CO2 )
