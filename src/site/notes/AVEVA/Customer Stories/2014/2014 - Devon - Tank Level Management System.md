## Description
Oil production from the Devon owned fields in Alberta is typically stored in tanks close to the well-head. When these tanks are full, trucks are dispatched to pick up the product from the tanks, and carried to the relevant processing plant. To help production analysts and operators to monitor production tank status and to maximize the efficient use of the truck fleet, delivery of product, and prevention of overflow and production outages, Devon wants to implement a Tank Level Management Solution (TLMS) based on OSIsoft products for all of its production tank storage facilities.
