## Description
TenneT TSO operates a considerable number of complex systems for energy transport that are geographically widely distributed. These include maintenance-intensive offshore systems, whose maintenance measures require a great deal of effort and planning. To optimize these necessary maintenance measures, an "Industry 4.0" solution enables smarter maintenance planning in a predictive, condition-based and optimized manner on the basis of advanced analytics from process and plant timeseries data. By bringing together existing information from underlying individual subsystems into a common data infrastructure, digital twins are created for structured and systematically normalized/contextualized asset analytics that are made available in TenneT datacentre. The information is enriched with business-relevant data such as service intervals, asset information and operating capacity utilization.
