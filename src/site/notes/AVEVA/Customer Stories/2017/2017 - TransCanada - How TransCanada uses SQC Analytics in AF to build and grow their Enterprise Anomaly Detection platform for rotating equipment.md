TransCanada US Gas division has built a platform for identifying functional degradation through anomaly detection across their diverse rotating equipment fleet. This program has driven “just-in-time” condition based maintenance and significant savings through failure avoidance. The discussion will focus on: - The use of AF, in particular the design of SQC Analyses in AF Server 2017 for scalability and rapid growth - Technology and process best practices for building and maintaining thousands of statistical models, given the dynamic operating conditions across a large geographical footprint - Managing the investigative workflow from initial detection, through failure avoidance savings
