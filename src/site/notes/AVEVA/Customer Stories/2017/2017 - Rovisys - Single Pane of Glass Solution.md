Brian Polaski

Brian Polaski is a Facility Manager at RoviSys with extensive PI System experience. He started with the very first release of the PI System 3.0 on a Windows platform in the early 1990’s and has since integrated the PI System across all of the major industries. He empowers customers to find the best and highest use of their PI System including how to leverage information from their PI System to make business decisions. Brian is a specialist in integrating Power Monitoring Systems (PMS). Over the last decade he immersed himself in the data center industry and developed a PMS utilizing the PI System as the infrastructure. It was through his dedication to this integration work that he spawned a RoviSys solution to assimilate disconnected systems to be presented in a “Single Pane of Glass” that can be used across industries.
