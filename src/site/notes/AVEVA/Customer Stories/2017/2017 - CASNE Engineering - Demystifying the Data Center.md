### Demystifying the Data Center

*PI Coresight was renamed PI Vision in 2017*

Digital Realty Colocation (formerly Telx) is a leading provider of interconnection and colocation services. Digital realty’s Engineering Data Warehouse (EDW) uses OSIsoft’s PI Server™ to collect and store over 50,000 critical space data points to the system daily. The backbone of the Data Warehouse is Asset Framework (AF) Model, which provides an asset structure that helps drive asset analytics and critical Key Performance Indicator (KPI) visualizations. Developed by Casne Engineering Inc., this model calculates and drives real time data displays created using PI Coresight™, and provides crucial forecasting data with regards to each of its facilities Power Utilizations Efficiency (PUE) quotients. The highlight of the EDW is the Energy Management’s Capacity Planning Platform used to track and determine the most efficient space to bring in new assets while maintaining the ideal margins of power to ensure the continuity of power supply to their entire customer portfolio.
