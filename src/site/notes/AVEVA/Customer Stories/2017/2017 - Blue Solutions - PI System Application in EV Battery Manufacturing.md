## Description
Blue Solutions, owned by French conglomerate Bolloré, is a producer of complete electrical components for capacitors, and now holds over a third of the global market. Building on this expertise and following 20 years of R&D, the Group has perfected batteries and electrical storage solutions based on unique LMP® (Lithium Metal Polymer) and supercapacitor technology. In an era when sustainable development and electricity storage issues have become major challenges for citizens, cities and states, the Bolloré Group is using this expertise to develop solutions for the storage and smart management of electricity.This presentation will introduce how the PI System is currently being using in manufacturing sites to support the complexity of developing a new technology. It will also offer a glimpse into the future potential of data being used across the assets lifecycle.
