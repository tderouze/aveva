### Condition Based Maintenance and Smart Monitoring in Frade FPSO with the PI System

_PI Coresight was renamed PI Vision in 2017_

To enable Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) Chevron Brazil, in partnership with Radix Engineering, implemented solutions for Emergency Valves Monitoring and Subsea Critical Limits Monitoring using the PI Event Frames to detect, record and analyze events with well defined start and end conditions. Furthermore, with the goal of moving from an active monitoring to a reactive monitoring approach, the new PI Notifications 2016 was implemented to reduce the response time to events and the effort required to monitor all the critical conditions. The new integration with the PI Event Frames allowed a faster configuration and maintenance for the notifications. All the monitoring displays were published to PI Coresight, allowing the IT department to maintain the solutions with a governance model and the users to share information and collaborate. The company was awarded by IT Mídia the Most Innovative Company in IT Usage in Oil & Gas, Chemical and Petrochemical sector, at the end of 2016.
