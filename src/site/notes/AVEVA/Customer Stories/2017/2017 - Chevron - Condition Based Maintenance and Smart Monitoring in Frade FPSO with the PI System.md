## Challenge-Solution-Benefit
### Summary
Chevron Brazil leveraged the PI System® to enhance operational intelligence at their Frade FPSO facility. By integrating technologies like PI AF, PI Asset Analytics, PI Event Frames, and PI Coresight™, they transitioned from manual, preventive maintenance to condition-based and event-driven approaches for emergency valves. Smart monitoring solutions automated KPI tracking and hydrate detection, reducing costs, improving efficiency, and enabling real-time actionable insights. The project demonstrated success through substantial financial savings, 90% time reduction in data analysis, and scalable infrastructure for future predictive analytics.

---
#### Challenges
Chevron faced challenges with traditional preventive maintenance for emergency valves, lacking real-time and historical condition data, leading to full system downloads during inspections and high offshore costs. Additionally, smart monitoring systems failed to provide real-time status, aggregated KPIs, or automated event detection, relying on manual processes and fragmented data.

#### Solution
Chevron implemented the PI System® to automate data analysis, event detection, and notifications. For emergency valves, they used PI AF Element Templates, Symbol Templates, PI Asset Analytics for complex status determination, and PI Coresight™ for web dashboards. An Excel add-in (C#/.NET) processed historical data. For smart monitoring, PI AF Asset Analytics calculated KPIs, PI Event Frames detected critical conditions, and PI Notifications alerted engineers. Dashboards were standardized for real-time and aggregate status visibility.

#### Benefits
Results included $350k savings on offshore systems, $300k/year potential savings on third-party monitoring, 90% reduction in intelligence gathering effort, improved onshore surveillance and decision-making via CBM, and significantly faster response times through automated event detection and notifications.

### Condition Based Maintenance and Smart Monitoring in Frade FPSO with the PI System

_PI Coresight was renamed PI Vision in 2017_

To enable Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) Chevron Brazil, in partnership with Radix Engineering, implemented solutions for Emergency Valves Monitoring and Subsea Critical Limits Monitoring using the PI Event Frames to detect, record and analyze events with well defined start and end conditions. Furthermore, with the goal of moving from an active monitoring to a reactive monitoring approach, the new PI Notifications 2016 was implemented to reduce the response time to events and the effort required to monitor all the critical conditions. The new integration with the PI Event Frames allowed a faster configuration and maintenance for the notifications. All the monitoring displays were published to PI Coresight, allowing the IT department to maintain the solutions with a governance model and the users to share information and collaborate. The company was awarded by IT Mídia the Most Innovative Company in IT Usage in Oil & Gas, Chemical and Petrochemical sector, at the end of 2016.
