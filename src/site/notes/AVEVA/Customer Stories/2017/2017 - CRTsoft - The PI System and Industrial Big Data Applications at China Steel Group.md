### The PI System and Industrial Big Data Applications at China Steel Group

*PI Coresight was renamed PI Vision in 2017*

China Steel Group, located in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, was founded in 1971. CSG has been an OSIsoft customer for nearly a decade and has massive amounts of historical operational data. Using the PI System's Asset Framework and Event Frames, this data has been prepared for big data and advanced analytics initiatives. The iEM Hypersphere Model technology utilizes machine learning methodology to discover insights. Asset Analytics helps operations by capturing important events in real-time, which are visualized with PI Coresight. The PI System enables intelligent assessment of equipment condition, production and process optimization, as well as early fault warning, allowing CSG to meet its operational and maintenance targets.
