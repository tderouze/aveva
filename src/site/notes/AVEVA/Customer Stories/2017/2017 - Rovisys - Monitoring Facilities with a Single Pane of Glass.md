#### PRESENTATION

## 2017 - Regional Seminar - Charlotte

### Monitoring Facilities with a Single Pane of Glass

Via a single pane of glass, the system can monitor mechanical, electrical and facility (security, environmental date, etc.) data. For a Data Center we even tie into their DCIM. A holistic picture is provided using AF templates with associated analytics and then viewed in PI Vision as a single panel of glass.
