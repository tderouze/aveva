### Summary
NASA Langley Research Center used the AVEVA PI System to improve real-time energy management. They faced challenges in meeting energy intensity reduction goals due to limited budgets, older facilities, and data quality issues. The PI System was implemented to monitor meter data quality, provide real-time building-level energy data, and allow facility operators to track energy consumption effectively. Key benefits include increased data accuracy, faster analysis, and broader staff access to energy data, leading to significant cost savings.

---
#### Challenges
Meter data quality issues (gaps detected late), time-consuming manual data analysis, limited access/training for existing tools.

#### Solution
Implemented PI System, creating PI tags from meter data (OPC interface with meter module outputs and virtual meters). Asset Framework for real-time calculated attributes and dashboards.

#### Benefits
Improved meter data accuracy and real-time visibility, faster demand analysis, enhanced facility staff monitoring, reduced energy consumption, and cost savings.
