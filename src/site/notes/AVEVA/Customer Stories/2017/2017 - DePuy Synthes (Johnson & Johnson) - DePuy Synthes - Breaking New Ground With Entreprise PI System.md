In this presentation DePuy Synthes explain how they have used an enterprise PI System to transform the Cork manufacturing site from a site with multiple different reporting applications and data sources to a site with a single location for all asset utilization data, process data and facilities monitoring data. By standardizing on OSIsoft tools they significantly reduced development time and costs. The PI System allowed them to analyse and improve the asset utilization across the site.
