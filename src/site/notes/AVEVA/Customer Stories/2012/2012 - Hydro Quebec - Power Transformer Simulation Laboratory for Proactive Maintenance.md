### Summary
Hydro-Québec, the largest electric utility in Canada, is using the AVEVA (OSIsoft PI System) and Microsoft StreamInsight to develop a proactive maintenance strategy for its power transformers. The 'Power Transformer State Evaluation Models for Sustainability and Maintenance' (MEET-PM) research project focuses on utilizing on-line diagnostic data from 90 power transformers linked with a SCADA system to establish the dynamic state of equipment, detect early signs of degradation, and ultimately optimize asset life and reduce the risk of unexpected failures. The solution involves a simulation laboratory that simulates transformer behavior, acquires measurements in PI Points, estimates measurements using physical models, and detects defective or degrading states using Microsoft StreamInsight.

#### Challenges
Power transformers are critical and costly components of Hydro-Québec's network, with an average age of 31 years. Unexpected transformer failures can lead to costly outages. There's a need for up-to-date information on transformer health to proactively avoid malfunctions.

#### Solution
Hydro-Québec is using the OSIsoft PI System and Microsoft StreamInsight to implement a Power Transformer Simulation Laboratory for Proactive Maintenance. This involves simulating transformer behavior, acquiring measurements, estimating values based on physical models, and detecting degrading states.

#### Benefits
Maximization of asset life, reduction of risk and cost associated with unexpected failures, and maintenance/inspection driven by asset condition.

## Description
Since 2008, Hydro-Quebec, one of the largest electrical companies in North America, has undertaken a major project of online maintenance for its power transformers and other transmission apparatus called IMAGINE. The data gathered from diagnostic devices installed on more and more transformers is now transmitted, collected and centralized in a data historian—the PI System. The aim of the project is to go from the current preventative maintenance approach to a predictive or proactive maintenance approach. In 2011, we started a research project on power transformer predictive maintenance called MEET with the object to use the acquired at a to refine our power transformer behavior models. This paper presents the infrastructure, experimental setups and experiments done so far int he research project. One goal of the MEET project is to devise a system to help in the proactive detection of transformer's state degradation in order to avoid fault conditions. The general setup is composed of a power transformer simulator that generates normal condition measurements and abnormal condition measurements based on different problematic situations. These measurements are gathered in the PI Server. The PI Server is further equipped with the Microsoft StreamInsight module to help in the detection of these different degrading conditions using complex event processing. The detection of degrading condition is done by comparison of the measurements received and the theoretical values based on the normal condition of a transformer exposed to the same operational conditions.
