### Summary
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), the largest electricity utility in Malaysia, implemented AVEVA's PI System to unify its diverse power plant fleet's operational data. The company initially engaged a vendor for a pilot project and then transitioned to an in-house implementation approach to build internal competency. This allowed them to realize substantial cost savings, improve performance analysis, and even offer PI System deployment services to other companies. TNB continues to expand the PI System's capabilities and data coverage, enhancing its operational efficiency and creating new revenue streams.

#### Challenges
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) faced challenges with a diverse power plant fleet, inhomogeneous sources of operational data, real-time process data locked within isolated control systems, and reliance on offline data for technical performance and business intelligence.

#### Solution
TNB deployed AVEVA's PI System as a unified real-time data platform, making data easily accessible to all staff. They adopted an in-house implementation approach to build internal competencies and continuously developed in-house applications.

#### Benefits
The implementation of the PI System resulted in plant data being available to all personnel, over USD 7 million in savings from the in-house project implementation approach, and over USD 10 million in tangible savings from plant analysis and optimization. TNB also generated revenue by providing PI System deployment services to others, developed staff skills, increased operational awareness, and diversified its business.

## Description
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) is the largest electricity utility company in Malaysia, with over RM70 billion in assets, and core activities in electricity generation, transmission and distribution. TNB is also involved in providing support services (repair, test and maintenance) and project services (engineering, procurement and construction) for both internal and external power plant customers. This presentation shall outline the efforts taken by the Power Generation Division of TNB in enhancing the management of its business portfolio by implementing the PI System and trace the evolution of the PI System within the Division from 2005 until today. Tenaga's diverse fleet of power plants includes one coal-fired station, six gas-fired stations and three hydro stations, encompassing a very wide variety of data sources and interfacing methods. This presentation will explain the strategies used and challenges faced in deploying the PI System throughout the large fleet, as well as the various initiatives taken to promote the system and obtain buy-in from the end users. Key application modules using the PI System that have been developed in-house for condition monitoring and management reporting—such as centralized fleet monitoring, automatic incident notification, dynamic plant schematics and many others—will be described, along with the benefits gained in terms of value and staff productivity. This presentation will conclude by describing how the Power Generation Division of TNB has gained a business advantage by evolving from being just a PI System user to a PI System service provider with the capability to offer system integration services to other divisions within the organization, as well as to external parties.
