## Description
PEM of RWTH Aachen University is one of the leading research institutes on electric mobility. Lithium ion battery cells are one of the main cost drivers for e-vehicles. The complex production requires high quality processes and an additional large amount of testing efforts. With the complex processes and various input factors many cause-effect correlations are unclear at present. In Aachen complete battery cells, modules and packs can be produced and tested. By using “Big Data” and “Industry 4.0” together with their partners OSIsoft, PTC, National Instruments and HPE, PEM is convinced that the quality of the battery production can be enhanced significantly. Moreover, by an ideal predictability and process adaptability testing efforts could be reduced to a minimum or even eliminated. In Aachen the consortium partners work on a demonstrator in a real production environment to validate that their technologies combined in a joint solution stack can support such adaptable process chains.
