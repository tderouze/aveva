## Description
Helen Sähköverkko Oy (HSV) is the distribution system operator on the City of Helsinki area. With 360 000 customers it belongs to the top three DSOs in Finland. HSV has implemented the PI System in 2011. In the beginning the PI System was purchased mainly to replace the in-house developed EMS data historian. Quickly, it was realized that the PI System has a great potential to bring the knowledge from the various process systems to the users. The presentation goes through the development phases, for example PI AF implementation, and the business benefits Helen Sähköverkko Oy has reached using the PI System.
