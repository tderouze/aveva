## Description
> Hershey needed to grow its international brand, but it was critical to do so in a scalable, sustainable manner
> Managing costs was key, and it was important to not sacrifice quality in the process
> 
> To be successful, Hershey needed to leverage the power of data in its supply chain 
> However, information needed to be digestible and easy to understand 
> It was also important to minimize training and long-term support for end users
> Using the PI System, particularly AF, Hershey created flexible, scalable and configurable data structures and calculations to better understand overall  asset performance 
> 
> Using PI AF, Hershey created a digital supply chain that offered end-users insights into equipment needs/maintenance, gave the right context to **understand throughput** and enabled them to **understand quality deviations** to make critical adjustments before issues arose
> 
> Overall, the team **reduced maintenance** costs by 33%, **throughput losses** by 30% and **quality losses** by 22%-------------------------------------------------------

**Challenge:**
- Keep up with global expansion and strategic acquisition, and gain real-time operational visibility into equipment, critical to insuring the efficient, safe delivery of high-quality, great tasting snacks

**Solution:**
- A digital supply chain that gave users insights into line performance and equipment needs
- Securely connect IT and OT systems for greater visibility into operations 
- Enable the integration of high-level business systems with operational dashboards

**Benefits:**
- Reduced maintenance costs by 33%
- Throughput losses down by 30%
- Quality losses down 22%
