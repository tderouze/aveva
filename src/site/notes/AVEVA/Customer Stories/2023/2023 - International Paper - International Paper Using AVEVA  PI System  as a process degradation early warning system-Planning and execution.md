### International Paper: Using AVEVA PI System as a process degradation early warning system-Planning and execution

International Paper (IP) has used AVEVA PI System for process monitoring for decades. One technique was to employ a large cadre of subject matter experts for a detailed audit of each facility every 3-4 years. These teams often found unnoticed process degradation that had occurred for months or years. In 2020, IP began investigating how to use AVEVA PI System to identify process degradation more quickly and allocate the subject matter exports in a more data-based fashion. Learn end-to-end tips and techniques for using AVEVA PI Server asset framework, AVEVA PI Vision, and AVEVA PI Integrator for Business Analytics to successfully implement an enterprise monitoring system quickly. Highlights include leveraging asset framework templates, modular design, and centralizing data via PII4BA.
