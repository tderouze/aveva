### Summary
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), in collaboration with Accenture Federal Services (AFS) and leveraging AVEVA PI System, is building a digital platform to address challenges in data management, IT infrastructure, and business processes. The initiative focuses on fostering innovation in operational teams by improving data accessibility, enabling self-service capabilities, promoting radical collaboration between IT, OT, and business units, and enhancing asset health. This leads to better operational performance, asset reliability, and compliance. The ultimate goal is to establish an Asset Health Hub for Operations.

#### Challenges
TVA faced challenges including data navigability issues, a gap between data and insights, siloed business processes, an aging historian system, compliance gaps, complex network topology, and high total cost of ownership.

#### Solution
TVA, powered by the AVEVA PI System and in partnership with Accenture Federal Services, implemented a digital platform to foster innovation. This included deploying the first PI System in AWS GovCloud, streamlining architecture across business units, implementing zero-trust authentication and data encryption, and creating a business innovation environment.

#### Benefits
The implementation resulted in a business innovation environment, streamlined architecture, zero-trust authentication & data encryption, flexibility to adjust resources for historical data migration, a production-like setting for rapid development, new integration standards for adding OT data and re-platforming custom applications, and meeting modern cybersecurity requirements. Enhanced data accessibility drove progress in operational performance, asset reliability, and compliance. Specific improvements included operational efficiency, process optimization, minimized unplanned downtime, early failure identification, anomaly detection, investment planning, environmental compliance, and safety compliance.

## Description
In the ever-evolving landscape of power generation, companies face significant challenges in modernizing their technology infrastructure to enhance asset reliability, maximize production efficiency, and ensure sustainable operations. This presentation will delve into a comprehensive project aimed at building a Digital Core for Operational Technology (OT) Data for the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates across Nuclear, Coal, Gas, and Hydro energy verticals and manages the transmission grid for the Tennessee Valley.

The project addressed critical issues with existing historian systems, which were limited in functionality, lacked modern cybersecurity capabilities, and incurred high total costs of ownership. By leveraging Agile methodologies, radical business collaboration, and Accenture's technical depth, the project successfully delivered a robust digital platform within the AWS GovCloud environment and powered by AVEVA PI System.

Join us to explore the innovative approaches and best practices that led to this successful deployment.
