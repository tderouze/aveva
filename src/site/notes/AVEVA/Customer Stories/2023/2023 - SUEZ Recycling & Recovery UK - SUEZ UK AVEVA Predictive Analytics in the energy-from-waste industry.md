### SUEZ UK: AVEVA Predictive Analytics in the energy-from-waste industry

SUEZ UK operates 11 energy-from-waste plants across the UK. We continually strive to reach even higher levels of reliability and are constantly looking for ways to improve the operation and maintenance of our plants. The first waste management company in the UK to implement predictive analytics, we have successfully used AVEVA Predictive Analytics in a pilot project to model water tube boilers, steam turbine generators, and other auxiliary systems. Hear about why we selected AVEVA Predictive Analytics, how the system was successfully piloted on an energy-from-waste plant, including the issues it identified, and about the high-speed deployment of predictive analytics across our UK sites.
