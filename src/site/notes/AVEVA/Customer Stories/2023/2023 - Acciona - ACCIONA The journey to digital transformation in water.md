Water scarcity today means that efficiency in water production and treatment processes is no longer a choice; it's an obligation. Five years ago, ACCIONA embarked on its journey towards the digital transformation of water and chose to utilize AVEVA's tools to build digital solutions that would help enhance production processes. In this talk, we will showcase the path we've taken, the technologies we've implemented, and the tools we've created to achieve our objective: making our world more sustainable.
