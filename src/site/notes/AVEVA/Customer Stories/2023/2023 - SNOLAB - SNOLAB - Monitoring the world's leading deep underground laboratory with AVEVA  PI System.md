### Summary
SNOLAB, a leading deep underground laboratory, partnered with AVEVA to overcome challenges related to data visibility and operational efficiency. By implementing the AVEVA PI System, SNOLAB was able to collate and structure data, improve root cause analysis, and enable predictive analytics. A use case involving a power outage demonstrates how the AVEVA solution helped SNOLAB understand bridging power requirements and validate operational events. This ultimately ensures experiment uptime for critical research such as supernova detection and dark matter studies.

#### Challenges
SNOLAB faced challenges including a lack of visibility into operational data hindering root cause investigations, data silos preventing insights for maintenance, equipment failure analysis, and event reconstruction.

#### Solution
They deployed AVEVA™ PI System™ to centralize data collection, improve data visibility, and reconstruct events, creating a unified platform to monitor and trend lab cleanliness, and providing autonomy to scientists to create trends based on experiment and operations data.

#### Benefits
SNOLAB gained improved visibility into vital operating data, enabling root cause investigations, ensuring performance metrics for uptime, and moving towards predictive analytics. This resulted in better experiment uptime, data-driven design, validated event requirements, cost savings (66% in the use case), and preparedness for critical scientific events (supernova detection, dark matter research).

## Description
Operating the world's deepest and cleanest underground research facility, SNOLAB uses AVEVA  PI System  to remotely monitor critical infrastructure and Nobel Prize-winning experiments. The facility's unique, low-radiation environment supports a world-class astroparticle physics research program and helps researchers explore important questions about the evolution of the universe. SNOLAB will use a recent weather event to discuss how it uses AVEVA PI System for monitoring and performing root cause analysis on its 3 megawatt backup generators and 1 megawatt chiller infrastructure. The session also covers SNOLAB's goals to use advanced analytics to predict condition-based maintenance requirements.
