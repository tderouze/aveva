Learn how Cargill assisted businesses with multiple manufacturing facilities and an extra-small footprint, such as feed mills, grain elevators, transport ships, and small meat processing plants, to implement a cost-saving solution without any dedicated IT resources and limited data streams per site. In addition, hear how AVEVA Edge Data Store served as the local storage solution that enabled them to use a centralized AVEVA PI Server for data aggregation.
