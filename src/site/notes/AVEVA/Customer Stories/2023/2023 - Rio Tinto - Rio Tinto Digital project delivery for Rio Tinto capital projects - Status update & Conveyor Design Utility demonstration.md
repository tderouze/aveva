#### PRESENTATION

## 2023 - AVEVA World San Francisco - Process Industries (Chemicals, MMM, Pulp/Paper)

### Rio Tinto: Digital project delivery for Rio Tinto capital projects - Status update & Conveyor Design Utility demonstration

RT Projects, the project delivery group within Rio Tinto, has been developing and implementing a digital project delivery strategy since 2020. Implementation involves a data-centric, class-library-driven, 3D intelligent engineering design and project delivery model, in combination with a digitally enabled AWP project execution methodology. A key part of the platform development has been setting up a hosted project delivery environment configured to RT Projects' specific requirements, i.e., the corporate class library and tagging standards. To increase the efficiency of project delivery using the tools in a hosted environment, RT Projects has developed productivity-enhancing features. This session will demonstrate a parametric utility for conveyor design and modeling. The utility provides a quick and easy way to develop conveyor-supporting structures in accordance with the defined RT Standards using standard AVEVA E3D Design functionality.
