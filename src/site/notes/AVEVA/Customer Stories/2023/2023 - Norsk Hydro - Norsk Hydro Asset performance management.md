### Norsk Hydro: Asset performance management

Hydro was looking to improve the reliability of its assets, using data standardization and centralization, real-time monitoring and KPI calculations to maximize availability and performance and minimize unscheduled stops. The company has implemented a solution that has become the technological standard for asset monitoring, taking advantage of Industry 4.0 technologies such as IIoT, artificial intelligence and data integration. AVEVA PI System is the backbone of data convergence through the integration and contextualization of the asset tree in AVEVA PI Server asset frameworks, as well as the infrastructure data for the AVEVA Predictive Analytics, a standardized solution at Hydro to achieve an intelligent maintenance process. The project has been expanded to Alunorte for a Zero Breakdowns strategic program that has already averted a USM loss.
