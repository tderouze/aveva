### Summary
Salt River Project (SRP) utilizes the AVEVA PI System to manage its growing solar generation and energy storage resources. Facing the challenge of integrating intermittent solar and wind power, SRP deployed a 100 MWh battery storage system and connected it to the AVEVA PI System. This enables comprehensive data collection, analysis, and reporting, providing insights into battery performance, degradation, and potential failures. This is critical for optimizing battery operations, enabling better responses to power fluctuations, and facilitating informed decision-making regarding future battery deployments. Real-time data allowed SRP to identify and address Megapack dropouts and ACE effects that affected system balance.

#### Challenges
SRP's demand for solar power is rapidly increasing, necessitating battery storage to address the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy. To effectively integrate battery storage, SRP needed to enhance its understanding of battery capabilities, limitations, and characteristics.

#### Solution
SRP implemented a 100 MWh Tesla battery storage system called Bolster. Data from the Bolster site and individual Megapacks (34 in total) are integrated into SRP's centralized AVEVA PI System, facilitating streamlined data collection, access, analysis, and reporting.

#### Benefits
The AVEVA PI System provides a better understanding of how to deploy large-scale batteries in the future. It centralizes battery storage operations data, making it accessible across the enterprise for informed operational and planning decisions. Real-time data enables proactive maintenance and avoids system imbalances.
