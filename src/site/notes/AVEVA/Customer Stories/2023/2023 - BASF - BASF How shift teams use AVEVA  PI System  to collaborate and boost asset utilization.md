#### PRESENTATION

## 2023 - AVEVA World San Francisco - Process Industries (Chemicals, MMM, Pulp/Paper)

### BASF: How shift teams use AVEVA PI System to collaborate and boost asset utilization

How can BASF, the world s leading chemical company, create more business value from AVEVA PI System data? Learn how the Agricultural Solutions segment of BASF creates a full vertical integration from sensor data to decision making on the control room and corporate levels by adding context to AVEVA PI System data. Discover how this data is used in day-to-day shift operations at a process plant to improve collaboration and asset performance. Embracing the vision of Industry 5.0 and putting people at the center, BASF gives its teams this data during shift handovers, morning meetings, and industrial performance management routines, empowering manufacturing teams for smarter, safer, and more productive collaboration. Using real-world examples, we'll explore how manufacturing teams collaborate around AVEVA PI System data and how they can turn production losses found in this data into continuous improvement initiatives to improve OEE. The session shows a best practice process for using PI data in shift routines, adding context to sensor data with ShiftconnectorÂ® OEE, and reporting and visualization on plant and global levels.
