### Summary
Quebec Iron Ore, a subsidiary of Champion Iron Limited, operates the Bloom Lake Mining Complex. They faced challenges in equipment reliability, throughput, inventory tracking, emissions, and data transfer between OT and IT systems. To address these, they implemented AVEVA Operations Control, PI System, Data Hub, Predictive Analytics, and Production Management. The results include improved equipment health tracking, anomaly detection, identification of missing instrumentation, a solid base for business intelligence, and streamlined data transfer and reporting.

---
#### Challenges
Reliability of critical equipment needs to be improved to support expansion; Increase throughput to full nameplate capacity by debottlenecking production; Lack of pit to port inventory tracking and traceability of ore; Produce highest-grade with lowest emission iron ore, whilst tracking and reporting of energy and emissions; Allow systems across the whole company to make decisions automatically on live operational data (Industry 4.0).; Need to find a robust and efficient way to transfer data across OT and IT multiple times per day.

#### Solution
AVEVA Operations Control; AVEVA PI System; AVEVA Data Hub; AVEVA Predictive Analytics; AVEVA Production Management

#### Benefits
Improved health tracking of critical equipment; Catch equipment anomalies during operation; Identified where we lacked instrumentation throughout the process; Solid base for business intelligence decisions; Increased the efficiency of the data transfer between different platforms; Simplified the reporting via PowerBI; Management layer can make faster decisions based on aggregated operational data; Bridge the data layer between OT and IT; Make data more accessible to other users.
