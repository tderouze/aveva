### Mitsubishi Heavy Industries: Expanded Use of AVEVA PI System for the Energy Transition and Smart Infrastructure

Mitsubishi has used AVEVA PI System nearly 20 years, supporting monitoring/diagnostics of thermal power plants. AVEVA PI System became a core tool for data-driven work processes including remote monitoring, advanced analytics, data-driven maintenance, and remote support such as AI-based combustion tuning. This experience is now being extended to other Mitsubishi Heavy Industries businesses including environmental, oil and gas, logistics and transportation. This paper describes AVEVA PI System application at the Takasago Hydrogen Park, validating systems critical for the Energy Transition. A newly developed Energy Management System optimizes operations of a large CCGT power plant, multiple hydrogen generators of different technologies, hydrogen storage, and distributed energy from smaller GT and battery energy storage, multiple manufacturing facilities as well as interaction with local gas and electric utility grids. Future applications of this learning include interaction with the full range of renewable energy systems, CCUS (carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage) and evolving Smart Infrastructure around the world.
