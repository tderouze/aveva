Maple Leaf Foods began its digital manufacturing journey with AVEVA in 2016 by deploying AVEVA's Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) in Canada's largest processed meats facility. Maple Leaf Foods' vision for a new world of work was first unveiled in 2019. Since then, the company has been diligently building up their digital manufacturing infrastructure shaped by this vision. Over the past four years, they have successfully scaled their MES deployment across eight sites. As they look to the next stage of digital maturity, learn how Maple Leaf Foods has extended MES to further improve their daily execution discipline with IoT and AI-based capabilities (at their Heritage site).
