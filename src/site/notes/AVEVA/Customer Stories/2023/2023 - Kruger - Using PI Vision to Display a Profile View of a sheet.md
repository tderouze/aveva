### Summary
Kruger Inc., a pulp and paper company, utilized AVEVA PI Vision, AVEVA PI Server asset framework and AVEVA PI System Builder to create a real-time profile view of a sheet, addressing the challenges of displaying and analyzing sheet profiles, managing grade-dependent limits from an external system, and highlighting out-of-spec properties. The solution resulted in improved quality control, reduced maintenance, and enhanced process analysis capabilities.

---
#### Challenges
Kruger faced challenges in displaying and analyzing sheet profiles using multiple solutions. They needed a secure, remotely accessible solution without client installations, requiring minimal investment. The solution had to handle grade changes, integrate limits from an external system without data duplication, and highlight profile problems.

#### Solution
Kruger implemented AVEVA PI Vision to display the profile with color coding for challenging zones. They used AVEVA PI Server asset framework to order the data and link limits from their master system based on grade changes. AVEVA PI System Builder (and PI Builder in Excel) was used to deploy new profiles.

#### Benefits
The benefits included a centralized version of limits, reducing maintenance and errors. Real-time health monitoring improved quality and reduced rejects. Color coding facilitated quicker issue identification and response. The system enabled easy historical analysis for process improvement, and new profiles could be added quickly. Displays are more accessible from anywhere, people react more quickly to visual problems which leads to gain in quality. Great tool for real-time troubleshooting
