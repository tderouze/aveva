### Yinson: Integrating real-time operational data with engineering data to increase efficiency and sustainability

Yinson Production covers the full life cycle from early engineering and into operations of floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) units. The FPSOs are owned and operated by Yinson Production on behalf of clients with a vision to safeguard the integrity of the company assets throughout their entire life cycle by optimizing processes and providing data-driven recommendations for continuous learning, improvement, and development. To boost efficiency and increase profitability during the project execution and operations phase, Yinson Production needed to streamline data and move to a truly data-centric approach. It facilitated asset design using AVEVA's integrated engineering and design tools. In the operations phase, it used AVEVA Asset Information Management to facilitate change management, structuring, and visualizing engineering data (1D, 2D and 3D). It collected real-time data through the AVEVA PI system. Gain valuable insights from Yinson Production's experience.
