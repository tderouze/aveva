### Summary
Amcor, a global packaging leader, partnered with AVEVA to overcome challenges related to data visibility, manual processes, and lack of standardization. By implementing AVEVA MES and System Platform, they achieved significant improvements in OEE, cycle time, visibility, and reporting, leading to a more efficient and data-driven operation. Key to success was identifying critical assets, partnering with Q-mation and AVEVA for training and standard object creation, and building a local talent foundation.

#### Challenges
Lack of visibility into operational data; Manual data sharing and reporting processes; Needed a standard framework for data collection, sharing, and analysis.

#### Solution
Deployed AVEVA™ Manufacturing Execution Systems™ and AVEVA System Platform to improve real-time visibility, standardize data structure, and reporting KPIs; Defined an architecture for enterprise reporting and analytics.

#### Benefits
Improved OEE by 2% YoY in Blow Molding; 3% improvement in production cycle time; Increased visibility of PM and changeover effectiveness; Reduced operator manual entry and improved downtime reporting; Full visibility of asset utilization and Energy performance; Standard data structure to support analytics and AI; Automated and continuous commissioning of new assets.
