## Description
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Emergency Response Data System (ERDS) powered by the PI System has been viewed as a huge success by the NRC and industry. The integration of the PI Server, PI ProcessBook, and PI WebParts delivers emergency response managers a single pane dashboard of critical data to make informed decisions on emergency response. The ERDS' role is to provide NRC and the regulated community comprehensive situational awareness tool to capture and maintain an accurate, shared, operating picture. It provides decision makers from multiple stakeholder communities with a shared situational awareness of data from primary and secondary systems (i.e., Plant Operations and System-level Safety, Security, and Emergency Preparedness (SSEP) components) to integration of geospatial location based data and local meteorological data.

Having a mature tool in place that facilitates a common information sharing environment which can be accessed from multiple locationsÂ is a key element to improving critical infrastructure protection and the safety of our communities. Having tools such as ERDS built on the PI System will help the industry and NRC face the new challenges as the all-digital breed of reactors are brought online. Situational Awareness has expanded to include new and more complex cyber security controls and calls for the integration of location based data, data feeds from sensors, internal, and external data sources all while managing the exponential increase in critical digital assets (CDAs) associated with the new breed of digital reactors now under construction. The authors will share plans for:

- building on the stable PI System platform
- integrating new PI System products
- modeling and simulating emergency response scenarios using the PI System simulator
- integrating ESRI GIS for geospatial awareness of assets at risk and satellite communication technologies to deliver a comprehensive situational awareness tool to address the use case scenarios for monitoring and managing increasing cyber security threats to CIP and emergency response management
