### Summary
Uniper, a large European power company, uses AVEVA's PI System and Beran Instruments' vibration monitoring to manage asset risk. A case study is presented where a 330 MW CCGT unit experienced a vibration trip, preventing startup. The combination of Beran's vibration data and PI System data allowed for rapid diagnosis of a bent rotor. Uniper performed an in-situ trim balance, enabling the unit to return to operation during peak demand while planning a proper outage. SpheriCAL anomaly detection provided confidence in other process parameters.

#### Challenges
Permanent shaft bend, High Vibration, Unit cannot generate electricity, Risk of significant generation loss (6 months)

#### Solution
Beran vibration data for quick assessment, PI data for root cause analysis, SpheriCAL for anomaly detection, In-situ trim balance, ACM Smart Hub for collaboration, Dynamic operation principles.

#### Benefits
Avoided 6 months of lost generation, Planned outage, Unit back online during critical demand, Effective collaboration

## Description
This joint paper describes how the PI System at Uniper Technologies was used with specialist vibration monitoring equipment from Beran Instruments to manage a critical fault with a Steam Turbine at a UK CCGT Power Station. A unit at the station started to display adverse temperature readings during start-up followed by the 1/rev levels increasing rapidly with speed during the run-up. Further indications during the run-down and at barring showed cylinder distortion causing rub with a permanent shaft bend. The OEM advice was the vibration levels were severe enough to remove the unit from service, however the lead time for repair was circa 6 months. By utilizing advanced real-time monitoring and carefully targeted alarms the Station and Technology Centre devised a risk based strategy using the PI System and the Beran system to run with vibration levels usually considered unacceptably high. This kept the unit generating revenue for the whole 6 months and allowed the outage to be better planned
