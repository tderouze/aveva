One of the challenges that the clients communicate, is the lack of an integrated system to help them consolidate, visualize and understand their consumption of the various forms of energy they use (mainly electricity and natural gas) in effort to reduce their costs and better manage it and optimize it. Hatch has used PI as the platform to implement various Energy Management Information Systems (EMIS) based on NRCAN guidelines to help its clients achieve the objectives mentioned above. In the EMIS, Hatch divided the clientâ€™s plants process into a number of Energy Account Centers (EAC) and process areas to achieve more granular view of consumption Hatch has also leveraged the capabilities of PI Asset Framework (PI AF) to provide a modular and dynamic system that can be easily scaled up or down. In this presentation, Hatch will describe the approach that it used for the design, modularization, development, and implementation of an effective and flexible EMIS to one of its clients.
