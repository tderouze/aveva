### Summary
Shire Austria uses the AVEVA PI System to improve manufacturing processes, enable predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and optimize energy consumption. The PI System provides real-time data and analytics, allowing for better decision-making and improved operational efficiency. Shire's PI System implementation strategy involves a centralized department for coordination, standardization, and defined roles and responsibilities.

#### Challenges
Maintenance teams lacked knowledge for proper centrifuge training, leading to short maintenance intervals and production downtime. Increasing hollow-shaft fractures were found in centrifuges. Stand-by Teams were required to monitor technical systems.

#### Solution
Implemented vibration monitoring and power measurement of centrifuges using the PI System. Established a Technical Control Center (TCC) to monitor all technical systems.

#### Benefits
Improved centrifuge assembling, reduced maintenance costs, less production impact, higher asset availability. Immediate reduction of product loss, detection of equipment failures, and a basis for predictive/condition-based maintenance. Fast response to malfunctions. Eliminated the need for 14 Stand-by Teams and 2 Teams on 24/7 duty.

## Description
Shire will be sharing some PI use cases where a successful PI System Implementation was key for overcoming several Business Challenges with a positive outcome. It also will show how today's daily activities for different personas based on the plants in Austria is much easier since they started using PI. A key example recently implemented by Their Technical Control Center is the use of PI for Condition and Predictive based Maintenance Predictive Maintenance. In addition to that, Shire will provide an overview of their architecture, and other strategic facts of their system implementation, data streams, data storage that were key for the success of their business cases.
