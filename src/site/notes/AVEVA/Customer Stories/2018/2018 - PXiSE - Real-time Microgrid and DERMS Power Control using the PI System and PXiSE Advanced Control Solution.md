The PXiSE Advanced Control solution for microgrids and DERMS control not only manages supply and demand balances like other energy management systems but also mitigates load and voltage disturbances using fast, time synchronized feedback control, thus providing full operating control of all energy resources. The system is configured using PI AF database which significantly reduces configuration and maintenance time by many orders of magnitude, compared to traditional logic-based management system. Also provides easily configurable HMI, taking advantage of the PI Vision application, with enhanced alarm and control capabilities, and use of event frames. The PXiSE advanced control solution is designed to scale using a hierarchical structure to support large electric system with many DERs. For example, it can support microgrids and DERs nested within microgrids, virtual power plants (VPP), aggregated DERs. The system includes many built in functions, including: real-time information of data such as pricing, weather data, load and generation forecasting, demand optimizer, user selectable configurations, and advanced SCADA functions, including a built-in alarm management system and user notifications.
