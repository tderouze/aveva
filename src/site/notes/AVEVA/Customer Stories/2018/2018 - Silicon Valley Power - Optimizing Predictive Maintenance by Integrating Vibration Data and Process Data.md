### Optimizing Predictive Maintenance by Integrating Vibration Data and Process Data

Historically, process control and reliability data have remained in separate worlds. Technology trends like wireless connectivity, inexpensive sensors, cloud computing and AI are paving the way for integration of process control data and vibration data. This translates to improved operational efficiencies, significant cost savings and massive productivity gains. OSIsoft and Petasense have joined hands to make digitization both practical and achievable. Silicon Valley Power (SVP) recently integrated OSIsoft (process data) and Petasense (vibration data) solutions to optimize PdM outcomes. The integration of the two systems has equipped the engineers at SVP with a multi-parametric view of the data, better insights, diagnostics and more powerful analytics, and the ability to create predictive models. As a result, they have been able to significantly improve asset reliability, uptime and plant safety, and reduce unplanned downtime and maintenance costs.
