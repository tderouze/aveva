### Data Diode Cybersecurity for PI System

One of the primary challenges raised by the convergence of OT and IT is the need for operational data, such as PI System data, outside of the operational technology environment. This presentation and demonstration will illustrate the use of data diode cybersecurity technology to transfer PI System data one-way, from an OT environment to IT or the cloud, while securing the OT systems from all external threats. Attendees can expect to learn IT/OT convergence cybersecurity best practices, use cases, and how to enable external to access OT data without compromising the security of the operational network.
