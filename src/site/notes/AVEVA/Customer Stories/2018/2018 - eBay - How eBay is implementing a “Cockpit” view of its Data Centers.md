#### PRESENTATION

## 2018 - PI World - San Francisco - Enterprise Infrastructure

### How eBay is implementing a “Cockpit” view of its Data Centers

The presentation will discuss how eBay is implementing a integrated view of its OT and IT operations and how the various pieces integrate with the business. Key points: • Scale and the need to automate various processes and its positive impact on operations. • Reduce thousands of AF Templates to a manageable handful using analysis to manage equipment variance • How leveraging Datacenter Clarity LC® and PI as a key operational and capacity forecasting cockpit has significantly enhanced business visibility into the current real-time and future allocations of the data center. • View the future of “automating a datacenter” and the role that Machine Learning/AI plays in that future. The talk describes how the current integration of the PI System’s capabilities (AF and EF) when integrated with DC Clarity is providing a real-time/360 view of data centers. Which is providing improved resiliency, availability, real utilization, and enhanced visibility to fully integrate the DC with the Business Process
