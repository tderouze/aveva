### Fleet-Wide Remote Dredging Vessel Monitoring

As OEM of innovative dredging and pipe-lay equipment IHC has two major challenges: (1) enabling customers to optimize production; (2) minimizing their downtime. 1 requires in-depth knowledge on effectiveness of equipment; 2 requires continuous condition monitoring and instant root cause analysis. To tackle these challenges, IHC creates a fleet-wide vessel monitoring platform to service its clients and support IHC’s service department. Connecting vessels like cutter dredgers is complicated by instable offshore connectivity, limited IT knowledge onboard and customization between vessels. Within 2 months IHC developed a state-of-art monitoring platform for multiple vessel types. High resolution data of marine and mission equipment is being monitored. Well-designed dashboards provide intuitive insights. Users can build own dashboards to increase engagement. The PI architecture allows for enhancement with machine learning and advanced business analytics. IHC provides offshore innovation.
