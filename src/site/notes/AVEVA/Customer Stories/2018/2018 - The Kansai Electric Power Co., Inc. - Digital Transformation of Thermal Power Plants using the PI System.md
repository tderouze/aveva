Kansai Electric Power, presented digital transformations of thermal power plants using the PI System at the previous users conference. After that, we introduced the PI System to additional six plants and currently the PI System have been deployed at all the thermal power plants and head office in our company. Also, we have taken more advantage of the PI System, especially utilizing Asset Framework, Asset Analytics and so on. As a result, we got the benefits from improvement of power output, efficiency and availability, and saving of maintenance expense. In case of our 2000MW GTCC power plant, we save around 3 million USD per year with the PI System. In addition, combining the PI System with the extensive know-how of thermal power plants based on long-term operation and experience, we are offering consulting and engineering service, which we call Kansai-Value Creation Service, in short K-VaCS. As a part of K-VaCS, we provide remote monitoring services to thermal power plants with the PI System and consulting services to support an introduction of the PI System in collaboration with OSIsoft so that we can contribute the benefits of our customers. In case of a certain coal-fired power plant overseas which we provide our service, approximately 4 million USD per year have been saved from their expense.
