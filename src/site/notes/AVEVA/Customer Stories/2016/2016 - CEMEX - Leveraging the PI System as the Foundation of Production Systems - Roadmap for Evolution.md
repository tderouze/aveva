## CEMEX's Results

## Screenshots

CEMEX has been using the PI System for more than 20 years, evolving from simple, standalone PI System installations in cement manufacturing facilities to become the foundation of the company’s cement production management system. During this transformation, the PI System has gone through different evolution cycles, and particularly in the last evolution cycle, CEMEX has redefined its development strategy and adjusted to shifting business needs and changes in the global business environment, allowing the company to build a comprehensive project portfolio with sound business cases to be implemented according to CEMEX priorities."
