#### PRESENTATION

## 2016 - Users Conference - San Francisco - Life Sciences, Food and Beverage, Specialty Chemicals

### What’s Really Going on with your Beer's Fermentation?

Deschutes Brewery, the 7th largest craft brewery in the United States, began their journey in implementing the PI System Infrastructure in March of 2015. At last year’s Users Conference in San Francisco, Deschutes shared a quick win that was achieved utilizing the PI System Infrastructure which provided insight into a fermentation process deviation. This year’s presentation will discuss the lessons Deschutes Brewery learned during their first year with the PI System Infrastructure, as well as how the PI System improved quality and equipment utilization, saving Deschutes Brewery significant capital investment. The talk wil also revisit the fermentation process deviation from last year that has now been solved by utilizing the PI System Infrastructure.
