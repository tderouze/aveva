### Slab Casting Automation – Contextualize Raw Data into Operational Intelligence

ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada’s mission is to safely manufacture sustainable steel. It operates a scrap metal conversion and recycling center, an iron ore reduction plant, two steel mills, three rolling mills and two wire drawing mills. With the aim of establishing a standard platform for the production of long carbon steel products in Canada, starting with the slab casting production line, ArcelorMittal has successfully implemented an architecture revolving around the PI System to centralize data, add time context and operational intelligence in order to track the product and the production of batches, manage events and information relating to the quality of the product and to interact with the different layers of automation. Asset Framework and Event Frames are now part of the key tools to organize the data, tags and events and provide a much easier access to the maintenance, production and process data for the users. On the top of it, the PI System is now empowering users with data, enabling them to tweak the behavior of systems to improve process quality and reliability. In the future, Arcelor Mittal is looking to build production knowledge, increase analytics and capture client feedback."
