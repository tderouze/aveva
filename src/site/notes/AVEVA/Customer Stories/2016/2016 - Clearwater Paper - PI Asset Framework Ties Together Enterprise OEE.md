## Description
How do you tie together and manage a dozen different facilities, each with its own unique set of capabilities, technologies, and cultures? The country’s largest provider of private label tissue to retail grocery chains and a world-class manufacturer of bleached paperboard, Clearwater Paper has sought to answer that question since its spin-off from Potlatch Corporation in 2008. Historically, operational reporting happened at the mill level with each site developing its own Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) technology and metrics. The metrics all meant something different depending on the site, and the reports were not conducive to creating an enterprise view of OEE. To implement a standard OEE system across the enterprise, Clearwater invested in development of under-utilized PI System tools. When they started, less than 10% of their converting lines were connected to the PI System, and there were four distinct systems to collect downtime information across the company. Clearwater identified relevant manufacturing assets and ensured that they collected speed and availability information from those in the PI System. They built a simple Asset Framework hierarchy to represent the manufacturing assets, selected Parcview as the standard system to collect downtime information across the company, and linked Parcview to the PI System Event Frames via PI SDK. For the first time in the history of Clearwater Paper, they now have a consistent and comprehensive view of the efficiency of their manufacturing process and are allocating resources for capital improvement with more precision.
