## Description
With $15 billion in annual revenues in 2015, AES operates in 17 countries across four continents. AES Jordan is based in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The country has limited natural resources and increasing demand for energy. It operates state-of-the-art technology at the Amman gas-fired combined-cycle power station and the Levant Power plant. AES Jordan has been recognized for many awards and has received certification for ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001. To produce power efficiently and at lower costs, AES implemented the PI System in 2015 to help them achieve certification for ISO50001 and ISO55001 for energy and asset management. In his talk, Anas Diab will discuss how they used the PI System to set up real-time monitoring and daily online reporting for all plant equipment. AES was able to assess asset performance and efficiency as well as solve technical problems such as transformer limitation.
