## Description
Getting Value from Realtime Data (Smart Metering, Distribution Automation, Customer Interaction) is an ambition from the Liander Control Lab & the IT Advanced Analytics Innovation Team. The Team is working closely together with experts from OSIsoft, SAS Analytics and ESRI. The Ambition is to build a Real Time Data based Decision Support Solution that proactively signals to the Liander Control Room operators the potential risks and problems in the Electrical network (e.g. overloading of the cables, faults in connections and general performance of the LV-grid). This presentation shares the business goals, the solution stack and the amazing results thus far
