## Description
Deschutes Brewery, the 7th largest craft brewery in the United States, began their journey in implementing the PI System infrastructure in March of 2015. Initially, Deschutes successfully used the PI System to gain insight into their fermentation process that led to improved quality and equipment utilization. This year, Deschutes broadened the use of the PI System by implementing the PI Integrator for Azure to create analysis-ready data for Microsoft’s Cortana Intelligence Suite to make predictions on when to transition between phases in the brewing process. These operationalized predictions, continually made more accurate with Azure Machine Learning and institutionalized inside the PI System as future data, will lead to time savings, production efficiencies, and significant impacts on Deschutes’ business, which will be highlighted in this presentation.
