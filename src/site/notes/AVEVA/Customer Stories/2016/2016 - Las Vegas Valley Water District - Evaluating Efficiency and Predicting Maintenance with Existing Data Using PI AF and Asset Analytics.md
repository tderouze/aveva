### Evaluating Efficiency and Predicting Maintenance with Existing Data Using PI AF and Asset Analytics

Las Vegas Valley Water District is evaluating PI's ability to provide pumping efficiency and predictive maintenance by finding new uses for the available historical data using PI Analyses. By distributing an average pumping efficiency value derived from the station power used divided by the station flow across the pumps that are running, an average pumping efficiency estimate can be applied to each pump individually. That value over time, can be analyzed to choose which pumps are the most efficient to operate and which pumps should be scheduled for inspection. Automating this calculation using templates in PI AF gives us a new tool that could prove to save a significant amount on our single largest regular expense.
