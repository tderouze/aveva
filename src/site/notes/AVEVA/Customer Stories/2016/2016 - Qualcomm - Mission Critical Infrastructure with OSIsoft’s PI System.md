## 2016 - Users Conference - San Francisco - Facilities, Water and Energy Management

### Mission Critical Infrastructure with OSIsoft’s PI System

Qualcomm Inc is a world leader in 3G and next-generation mobile technologies. They implemented OSIsoft’s PI System to receive real-time Key Performance Indicator (KPI) data on mission critical facilities and IT Systems across five countries. Their high-availability design currently utilizes six different communication protocols to update 35,000 PI Points, 7,500 Asset Framework (AF) Elements, and 244,000+ AF Attributes. In addition to obtaining real-time KPI information and viewing operational data in dashboards, this system has simplified their alerting and operational management, enabled better historical trending and future capacity planning, and improved decision-making by providing reliable data and analysis. The PI System deployment is now supporting other Qualcomm business initiatives ranging from the Internet of Things to SmartCampus.
