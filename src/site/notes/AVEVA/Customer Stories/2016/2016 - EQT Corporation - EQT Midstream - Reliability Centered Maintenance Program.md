## EQT Corporation's Results

## Screenshots

EQT's Reliability Centered Maintenance Program (RCM) is a maintenance strategy focused on predictable failure modes. The value of EQT's RCM Program has been achieved by maximizing component life and reducing failures and downtime. RCM increases time based maintenance intervals and reduces the cost associated with required maintenance and increases efficiency by leveraging data accessibility and predictive analytics. EQT conducted an extensive evaluation of data historians and predictive analytics software companies during 2015. The result of EQT's evaluation was the selection of OSIsoft PI System as its single data infrastructure across EQT's Pipeline enterprise. The PI System demonstrated the ability to empower end-users with easy-to-use PI Client tools; optimize pipeline processes with insights gained through advanced analytics; and config notifications for automated alerts on unexpected conditions. It is projected that EQT's cost savings will be substantial each year from improved operational efficiencies and timely equipment maintenance.
