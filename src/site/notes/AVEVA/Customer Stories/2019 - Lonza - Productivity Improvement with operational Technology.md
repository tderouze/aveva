## Description
Production processes are controlled by a large number of sensors the LSI network is actually equipped with more than 150,000 of them! How can we improve our productivity in manufacturing, optimize costs and make our processes more reliable and efficient by making better use of digital technology? Within a successful RCIP project, we built a unified data management system based on OSISoft infrastructure across all plants by working closely with technology experts such as Microsoft and OSIsoft. With improved data availability and transparency, we can identify and address pain points and hidden inefficiencies much faster than in the past. Engineers now spend less time collecting data and more time developing solutions. The paper presents the successful RCIP program as a pilot in two Lonza production sites and demonstrates the business value in the process data.
