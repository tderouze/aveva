## Description
The chemical manufacturing environment is filled with thousands of missed signals, where providing the right type of analyzed data to the right person, at the right time, can reduce out of spec product, minimize equipment downtime, and improve raw material utilization. After having success using Statistical Process Control at various sites, Albemarle wanted to scale the success across their global enterprise using Asset Framework (AF), along with their analytics partners, Northwest Analytics & Sartorius-Stedim SIMCA, with Machine Learning. To escape pilot purgatory, Albemarle committed to training all Manufacturing Engineers as Super-Users within AF, SPC, and multivariate analytics. This widespread adoption of AI ("Albemarle Intelligence") ensures long-term sustainability, empowers the company's employees, and truly unlocks the value of information.
