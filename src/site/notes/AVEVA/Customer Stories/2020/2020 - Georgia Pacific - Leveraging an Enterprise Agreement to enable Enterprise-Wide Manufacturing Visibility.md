### Leveraging an Enterprise Agreement to enable Enterprise-Wide Manufacturing Visibility

Georgia Pacific (GP) identified that the PI System was to be a strategic platform and critical component of our Transformation across the corporation. GP set out to identify key resources who would support the development of standard KPIs across all levels of the organization for major assets. GP worked directly with an engineering contractor to develop the KPIs, decided on the engineering calculations behind the KPIs, and how those KPIs would be combined with Asset Framework templates to roll up PI Vision dashboards. While all sites are making paper and/or cellulose, they do it in very different ways. This means there are many inconsistencies across the mills. The dashboards utilize PI Vision to create a standard look across the fleet so that corporate subject matter experts do not need to have specific site knowledge to identify and debug the problems that may surface. The SMEs quickly recommend solutions to the mill personnel for those problems. This presentation will cover the process of the creation, configuration and visualization of the mill KPIs, along with the way the tool help SMEs interact with the different sites at GP.
