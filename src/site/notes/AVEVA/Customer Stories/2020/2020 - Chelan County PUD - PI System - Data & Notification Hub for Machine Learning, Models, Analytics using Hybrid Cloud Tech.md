### Summary
Hydro-Quebec uses AVEVA's PI Asset Framework (PI AF) to centralize and structure data from various enterprise databases (MDMS, SAP, DMS) into a unified view. A custom DB to PI AF import tool automatically detects database schemas, creates element templates and elements in PI AF, maintains hierarchy, and can be used periodically for versioning. This provides easy access to information and a structured view of PI Server data.
