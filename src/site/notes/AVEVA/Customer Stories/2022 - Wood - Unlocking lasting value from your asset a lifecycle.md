## Description
Digital twins have rapidly moved from technological curiosity to operational necessity for asset owners. But even best-in-class digital project delivery is unlikely to produce a digital twin that delivers lasting value in operations. So how can we ensure that needs of operating teams are identified early, captured in a holistic digital twin strategy which can then be implemented through the capital project to handover an operational digital twin alongside the physical asset?
