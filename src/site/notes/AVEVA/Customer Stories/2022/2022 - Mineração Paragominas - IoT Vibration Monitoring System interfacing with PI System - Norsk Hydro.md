At Hydro Paragominas, the PI System, in addition to fulfilling the role of historian of process data and performance of the areas, was also adopted as an official concentrating solution for interface with initiatives related to Industry 4.0. This project consists in the quick installation of Ifm's VSE family of vibration sensors and electronics. They were installed in critical assets of difficult vibration collection manually by the predictive team, with online collection can be made available on the PI Vision dashboard easily accessible through the corporate network. The project makes the most of PI System features and functionality such as connectivity and integration, structuring assets in PI AF, Analysis and Notifications with a focus on predictive maintenance, either via CBM, or using prediction rules through the signature of the vibration profile. All this infrastructure developed in the PI System is automatically carrying out the process of opening maintenance notes in the ERP.
