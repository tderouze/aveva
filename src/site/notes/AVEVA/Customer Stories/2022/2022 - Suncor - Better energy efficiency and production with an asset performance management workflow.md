## Description
Monitoring heat exchanger performance is crucial to profitability and sustainability as the inefficiencies introduced by fouling may result in increased energy consumption, GHG emissions, and/or production loss. Amongst other parameters, process duty, overall heat transfer coefficient, or fouling resistance can be used for monitoring fouling in heat exchangers. At Suncor, AVEVA Process Optimization (ROMeo) is being used to continually collect raw field data and transform the obtained raw data to abovementioned engineering metrics. Calculated values are then historized and used for further analysis to determine the optimum cleaning time. The simulation can also be used for conducting case studies to estimate the plant maximum processing capacity at a reduced performance. This information can assist Operations and Maintenance teams in making data-driven informed decisions.

Operation of Suncor s co-generation assets are underpinned by Suncor s APM (RAW) program which seeks to maximize production performance, optimize maintenance via accurate insights into equipment health, and minimize unplanned production loss via early warning detection of abnormal equipment behavior. To facilitate this Suncor utilizes PI Asset Framework, AVEVA Process Optimization in combination with AI-driven anomaly detection capability of AVEVA Predictive Analytics; jointly referred to as Predictive Asset Optimization. As a consequence of this enhanced knowledge of asset performance, maintenance can be better prioritized in advance, the return on investment generated by maintenance expenditure can be validated and operational risks associated with equipment health are mitigated.
