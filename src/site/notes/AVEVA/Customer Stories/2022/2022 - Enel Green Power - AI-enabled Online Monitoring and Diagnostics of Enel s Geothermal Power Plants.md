### AI-enabled Online Monitoring and Diagnostics of Enel s Geothermal Power Plants

Geothermal power plants (GPPs) are an essential component in the world s shift to green energy, as it can provide carbon-free heat and continuous baseload power to compensate for the intermittency of wind and solar. To preserve its competitiveness, online monitoring and early diagnostics of critical assets is increasingly important for supporting and sustaining improvements in the economics associated with operating GPPs, while maintaining their high availability.
