Quebec Iron Ore (MFQ), the Bloom Lake Mine facilities is a 100% Quebec-based entity producing 7.4 Mtpa of high-grade 66.2% Fe iron ore concentrate in its first phase. The Phase II expansion proposes an average annual production of 15 Mtpa of 66.2% Fe iron ore concentrate, over a 20-year mine life. The Bloom Lake Mine facilities include a railway to efficiently transport the high-quality iron concentrate to a loading port in Sept-Îles, Québec To support the project expansion and digital transformation initiatives, Quebec Iron Ore (MFQ) is working with AVEVA leveraging the PI System and AVEVA's Operation Control to support a fast growth of operations in an efficient, easy and sustainable way. Integrated remote operations, inventory tracking from pit to port, and digitization of processes are some of the initiatives that are on our digital roadmap and collaboration.
