### Summary
Quebec Iron Ore (a subsidiary of Champion Iron Limited) operates the Bloom Lake Mining Complex and is undergoing a digital transformation journey using AVEVA Operations Control & Predictive Analytics, leveraging the AVEVA PI System as a data foundation. They faced challenges in evolving from Excel-based analytics, lacking a solid data foundation, having multiple isolated control rooms, needing to improve critical equipment reliability for phase two expansion, improving production traceability, and increasing real-time visibility of pit to port operations. The main challenge was reducing reaction time from event to resolution. To address these, they implemented a robust data architecture, AVEVA PI System, AVEVA Operations Control, AVEVA Predictive Analytics, and are evaluating AVEVA Production Management and AVEVA Unified Operations Center. This resulted in independent control rooms with a centralized data center, a robust temporal and structured data architecture, real-time asset analysis tools, and unified data visualization tools.

Quebec Iron Ore (MFQ), the Bloom Lake Mine facilities is a 100% Quebec-based entity producing 7.4 Mtpa of high-grade 66.2% Fe iron ore concentrate in its first phase. The Phase II expansion proposes an average annual production of 15 Mtpa of 66.2% Fe iron ore concentrate, over a 20-year mine life. The Bloom Lake Mine facilities include a railway to efficiently transport the high-quality iron concentrate to a loading port in Sept-Îles, Québec To support the project expansion and digital transformation initiatives, Quebec Iron Ore (MFQ) is working with AVEVA leveraging the PI System and AVEVA's Operation Control to support a fast growth of operations in an efficient, easy and sustainable way. Integrated remote operations, inventory tracking from pit to port, and digitization of processes are some of the initiatives that are on our digital roadmap and collaboration.
