### Pump Optimization: San Jose Water's AVEVA PI System implementation

<video src="https://cdn.osisoft.com/osi/presentations/2022-AVEVA-San-Francisco/UC22NA-02WW30-SanJoseWater-Smith-Pump-Optimization.mp4" poster="https://cdn.osisoft.com/osi/presentations/2022-AVEVA-San-Francisco/UC22NA-02WW30-SanJoseWater-Smith-Pump-Optimization.jpg" id="ctl00_MainContent_ctl00_presVideo" class="embed-responsive-item" style="background-color: black; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px" preload="none" controls="controls"></video>

Description: San Jose Water s implementation of the AVEVA PI System in part of a continued commitment to improve efficiency, better manage assets, and provide system operators with the best available data and analytics. Although the future use cases for the PI System are abundant, this talk will focus on the development and use of pump optimization dashboards to analyze and monitor pump efficiency and relative operational cost across San Jose Water s groundwater and booster stations. Attendees will acquire practical insight on how pump performance can be monitored with the PI System and the financial and environmental benefits that can follow.
