Overview SCG Chemicals is one of the largest petrochemicals companies in Thailand and a key industry player in Asia. The company s integrated operations include upstream production of olefins and downstream production of polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride. With its tightly integrated business, the company was at risk that individual equipment failure could shut down the entire production chain with direct implications for top and bottom-line financial performance. To address this risk, SCG Chemicals pursued a digital transformation initiative to harness data to build an advanced asset performance management (APM) a solution to monitor critical assets and predict failure towards a goal of zero plant shutdowns.
