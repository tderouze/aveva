### Summary
Chelan County PUD used AVEVA's PI System to address the challenge of wildfire risk management. They centralized data from various sources, developed PI Vision displays for monitoring, and automated alerts for fire weather conditions. This resulted in better decision-making, improved fire risk mitigation, and reduced potential suppression costs.

#### Challenges
Chelan County PUD faced challenges related to wildfire risk, including a lack of a centralized fire condition monitoring system, dispersed data sources (online and in-house), a lack of automated email and text notifications, and reliance on manual condition monitoring and weather forecasts. They needed a fire mitigation plan with risk analysis, analytics, and regular monitoring.

#### Solution
The PUD implemented a solution leveraging AVEVA's PI System to centralize data in the PI Archive using Asset Framework. This included government web data, sensor data (PI Tags), and forecast data. They developed PI Vision displays for enterprise-wide monitoring and created PI Analyses, Event Frames, and Notifications to automate alerts and track alert history. The solution also incorporated custom Windows Service, Oracle OSB, R Server and RStudio Connect.

#### Benefits
The benefits included leveraging a single ecosystem for time-series storage and analysis, centralizing data, enabling enterprise-wide monitoring with PI Vision displays, automating alerts through PI Analyses, Event Frames, and the Notification System, establishing a historical record for continuous improvement, and facilitating data-driven decision-making. Ultimately resulting in improved fire risk mitigation and reduced potential suppression costs.

## Description
Wildfires are an increasing risk to transmission and distribution utilities in the American West and around the world. At Chelan County Public Utility District in Washington State, our Fire Safety Outage Management group leverages available fire data and expert analysis along with forecasts and notifications to make informed, data-driven decisions about fire mitigation strategies and risk. In this presentation we will discuss our risk assessments, mitigation plan, and how the PI System integrates data sources, analyses, and digital notification systems in production today. We will discuss the PI System has many benefits and helps give the Fire Safety Outage Management group advance notice of when to consider public safety power shutoffs.
