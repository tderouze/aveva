### Summary
Toyota Motor Europe presented their use of AVEVA's PI System to reduce their carbon impact by eliminating energy waste. The presentation focuses on a pilot project in paint booths to minimize 'Muda' (waste) during both production and non-production times. By collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data, they aim to optimize energy consumption, detect abnormalities, and implement continuous improvement. The project resulted in significant energy and CO2 emission reductions during non-production time and is being rolled out to other factories and equipment.

## Description
As regional European headquarters, in Toyota Motor Europe (TME) promotes energy cost and CO2 reduction activities in the European Manufacturing Companies (EMCs). To do so, Energy data is centrally collected, managed and visualized using PI System as the European energy monitoring system (EnMS). In particular, TME focuses on biggest energy consumer with the aim of reinforcing operators capabilities. This way energy waste is made visible for experts to take action and grasp their impact. The purpose of this presentation is to highlight how PI System is used in TME, and how it supports daily operations in order to achieve our challenging future goals. Practical examples of the usage of PI System will be given, with focus on equipment energy monitoring. Additional information attached.
