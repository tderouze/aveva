### Summary
Chelan County PUD utilizes the AVEVA PI System to address challenges in water rights monitoring and river elevation modeling. For water rights, they improved real-time visibility and reporting by leveraging PI Asset Framework (AF) for data standardization and PI Vision for enterprise-wide monitoring. For river modeling, they developed an application to inform users of changing river conditions using PI data, data science, and the PI Web API.

---
#### Challenges
Visualize real-time water pump information and cumulative flows. Improve business reporting process from monthly Excel spreadsheet. Incorporate field device and water rights metadata.

#### Solution
Use PI AF to standardize data. Leverage PI AF templates to speed up development. Create PI Vision display for enterprise-wide monitoring.

#### Benefits
Site managers can monitor asset performance and identify problems real-time with PI Vision display. Tech shop can quickly detect data quality issues. Streamlines data reporting process to WA Dept of Ecology. PI solutions are flexible for future enhancements.

## Description
This presentation focuses on the PI tags, AF structure, and intuitive PI Vision display we developed to monitor water pumps as they pertain to water rights. Additionally, we have leveraged PI AF to digitize river elevation models and compare with sensor data to monitor boat launches, beach access, and recreational facilities that we maintain along the Columbia River. Combined with our LIDAR bathymetric survey, digital river modeling also has operational impacts by improving our near-term inflow estimates.
