## 2022 - AVEVA World San Francisco - Manufacturing

### How Sartorius uses spectral data to improve process models in the PI System

The use of different types of spectral instrumentation have exploded in the Life Science industry and so has the amount of data associated with this. Many new types of applications are depending on the additional information that you can get out of complex, information rich spectra to complement the normal setup of standard process parameters. For many years, Sartorius has been driving and developing data analytics techniques to understand and use spectral data to its full potential. We have now also enabled the use of such information in our own production and together with partners developed tools to help drive Digital Transformation and Automation by using all the data, compress or extract the hidden information and made it easily accessible from partner applications like the PI System or AVEVA Historian.
