## INPEX Corporation's Results

## Screenshots

This presentation mainly describes how INPEX Corporation fully migrated PI System infrastructure in Japan to Microsoft Azure with an aim of not only mitigating workloads required for maintenance, but also optimizing the overall corporate IT infrastructure. Together with the main theme of the migration, since INPEX will give a first presentation at PI World, the entire architecture of PI System across INPEX group, including INPEX Australia, will also be introduced. Initially conceived as an Enterprise Historian, the role and criticality of the PI System changed significantly. The PI System has especially been playing an essential role during the commissioning of Ichthys LNG - requiring a re-implementation of PI System infrastructure to meet the zero data loss philosophy.
