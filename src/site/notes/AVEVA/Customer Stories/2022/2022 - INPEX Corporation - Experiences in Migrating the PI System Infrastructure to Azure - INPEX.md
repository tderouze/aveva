## INPEX Corporation's Results

## Screenshots

This presentation mainly describes how INPEX Corporation fully migrated PI System infrastructure in Japan to Microsoft Azure with an aim of not only mitigating workloads required for maintenance, but also optimizing the overall corporate IT infrastructure. Together with the main theme of the migration, since INPEX will give a first presentation at PI World, the entire architecture of PI System across INPEX group, including INPEX Australia, will also be introduced. Initially conceived as an Enterprise Historian, the role and criticality of the PI System changed significantly. The PI System has especially been playing an essential role during the commissioning of Ichthys LNG - requiring a re-implementation of PI System infrastructure to meet the zero data loss philosophy.

### Summary
INPEX Corporation, Japan's largest oil & gas exploration & production company, successfully migrated its on-premise PI System infrastructure to Microsoft Azure. This presentation details the challenges INPEX faced with its aging on-premise system, the solution of migrating to Azure, the migration process, key success factors, and the resulting benefits. It also includes application case studies demonstrating the use of PI data for anomaly detection, condition-based maintenance, and condition monitoring.

#### Challenges
On-premise PI System located 300km from head office.
Time and effort for IT experts for hardware replacement and troubleshooting.
End of Life (EOL) of HW and OS was December 2021.
Internal IT expert shortage leading to additional labor cost for on-premise server management.
Difficult to troubleshoot system failures immediately.

#### Solution
Migrated PI System infrastructure in Japan to Microsoft Azure.
Migration completed in 10 months with an experienced IT vendor.
Replaced ProcessBook with PI Vision 2020.

#### Benefits
TCO of Azure is almost the same as on-premise.
No hardware maintenance or replacement required.
IT experts can focus on supporting process engineers with advanced PI System analysis.
