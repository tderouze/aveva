## Description
PI System Osisoft solution was deployed in Ence since 2015 in all the production plants. That millstone was a disruptive change to the organization since it enabled to start collecting data from many sources what helped Operation people to their decision making. After some workshops and internal research, in 2021 we realized that there was a big potential in OSIsoft tools that were not being taking advantage for (AF, Event Frames & Notifications) and could help Ence to achieve our goals in terms of Energy Efficiency, reduce operation downtime, minimize variability of the processes and automate manual tasks.
