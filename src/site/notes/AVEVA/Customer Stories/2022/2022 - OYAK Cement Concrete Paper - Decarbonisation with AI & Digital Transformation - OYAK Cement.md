The global cement industry accounts for nearly 5% of total global greenhouse gasses emissions, and also 7% of total global CO2 emissions. Therefore, the role of cement industry is critical on emission reductions to help the efforts on prevention of global warming. Accordingly, there has been many technological adaptations researched and applied by cement producers. All those are related with investments and technological adaptabilities. However, there are also more options are available. The operational data, and its great potential to support green production. While our digital transformation journey OYAK Cement 4.0: IndustrAI, we - as CIMPOR Global Holdings BV - focus on more sustainable future, products with low carbon footprints and decarbonisation based operational activities. At that point, AVEVA PI System is our main platform to collect, visualize, benchmark, notify and improve our performance on this journey. Our experiences and actions on this topic will be shared with use cases in our presentation.
