## OMV Exploration & Production GmbH's Results

## Screenshots

Challenge frequent failures (ruptures) of the compressor s membranes due to excessive stress, leading to gas flaring and partial production shutdown for membrane replacement. Solution Developing a scalable advanced analytics tool leveraging the global infrastructure of OMV's PI System that represents a single source of truth for operational data from equipment and processes. As a core component of OMV's Helius data ecosystem, the Pi AF is combining IT and OT data into a standard structure (standard hierarchy) across all our global assets. Data is seamlessly accessed by (Aveva partner) Seeq that is leveraging the PI Data Archive and PI Asset Framework to facilitate advanced analytics. The application of standard hierarchies significantly reduces the efforts for our Integrity and maintenance department to deploy successful analyses and models globally.
