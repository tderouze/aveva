### AVEVA & Waterfall: Physically Safe Data Hub Connectivity - The Gateway to Heaven?

Enterprise-wide and even Internet-wide access to operational data drives automation, efficiencies, and agility in times of rapid change. But in many industries and critical infrastructures, cloud connectivity comes with a material increase in industrial & OT cyber risk. The threat is real - today's ransomware groups target everyone with money, and use tools and techniques that a few years ago only nation-states used. In this presentation, we look at Unidirectional Security Gateways as physically safe cloud and Data Hub connectivity. We look at how to share all our operations & OT data safely to OSISoft Cloud Services and AVEVA Connect. Sharing safely means sharing widely, in real time, with zero risk to physical operations. Physical safety means safety from all cyber-sabotage attacks, no matter how sophisticated, both now and in the future. Join us to see how to profit from simple, seamless access to OT data, while outright eliminating the risk of cyber sabotage to important operations.
