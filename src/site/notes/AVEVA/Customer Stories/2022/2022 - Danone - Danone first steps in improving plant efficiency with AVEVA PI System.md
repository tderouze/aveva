#### PRESENTATION

## 2022 - AVEVA PI World Amsterdam - Consumer Products, Life Sciences

### Danone first steps in improving plant efficiency with AVEVA PI System

This presentation will explain how to provide visibility of manufacturing data to the entire plant organization, and how to give the right information to the right people at the right time in order to make the right decisions.

Danone started its journey to improve global plant efficiency three years ago with a Data Infrastructure approach based on Aveva's PI system. They first defined a manufacturing standard aligned to the ISA 95/88 standard for Assets and for Operations. Danone first deployed Aveva's PI in their Rotselaar plant before rolling it out to others. This internal standard along with the PI System s Asset Framework (AF), enabled the team to model the plant organization quickly and pull data from a wide array of sources, including process data from third-party software. Based on this first AF model, the team was then able to work on several business challenges such as CIP, OEE, Losses, Tracking .
