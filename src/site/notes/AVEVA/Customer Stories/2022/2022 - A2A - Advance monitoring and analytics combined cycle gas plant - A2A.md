### Summary
A2A, a power company, implemented AVEVA PI System to enhance the monitoring and analytics of its combined cycle gas plants. The project, named RADAMES, utilized PI Data Archive, Asset Framework (AF), PI Vision, and other tools to extract parameter statistics, model expected values, detect steady-state conditions, generate events, and provide real-time visualization. This enabled A2A to detect anomalies, such as condenser pressure issues, improve plant efficiency, and achieve economical quantification of parameter residuals. The system includes 15 PI Servers, up to 20 AF databases, more than 10,000 analyses, more than 1000 PI Vision displays and more than 200 users. This also resulted in web reports and energy balance side results. They are now focusing on performance comparison between plants using neural networks.

---
#### Challenges
Providing state-of-the-art real-time monitoring and analytics capabilities for the entire fleet. Choosing a common set of parameters to compare the plants. Managing more than 5GW of flexible power.

#### Solution
Deployed the latest AVEVA PI System technology, including PI AF to organize and analyze data and PI Vision with custom widgets to show data clearly.

#### Benefits
Increased operational efficiency, use of data to prevent faults, and significantly accelerated ‘Time to Value’ with the AF analytics engine.

Radames is project realized by A2A with e-matica for the entire A2A Combined Cycle Gas Turbine park for Power Generation to monitor performance and detect deviations from expected behavior The idea is that observing historical process data it is possible to forecast current expected behavior. This is possible by creating regression curves between environmental and process parameters so linking a parameter expected value to a set of measurements (e.g. expected Condenser Pressure function of river temperature and TV Power). In total 9 units have been modeled with an average of 30 parameters per CCGT for 4,5GW of electrical power. The model set up finally allowed to early detect failures / maintenance actions and to establish a relationship between deviation and extra gas consumption that is, in the end, economic loss.

Since 2016 I work in A2A: the largest italian multiutiliy. In the ICT group my challenge is to improve the digitization of the processes connected with the production of energy. From design to maintenance, I follow all the evolutionary process of the software by improving and capturing all the business needs. I took a master degree in applied physics developing analytical skills and specializing in the field of renewable energies.
