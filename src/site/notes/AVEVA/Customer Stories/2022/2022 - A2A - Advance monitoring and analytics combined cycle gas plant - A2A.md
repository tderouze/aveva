Radames is project realized by A2A with e-matica for the entire A2A Combined Cycle Gas Turbine park for Power Generation to monitor performance and detect deviations from expected behavior The idea is that observing historical process data it is possible to forecast current expected behavior. This is possible by creating regression curves between environmental and process parameters so linking a parameter expected value to a set of measurements (e.g. expected Condenser Pressure function of river temperature and TV Power). In total 9 units have been modeled with an average of 30 parameters per CCGT for 4,5GW of electrical power. The model set up finally allowed to early detect failures / maintenance actions and to establish a relationship between deviation and extra gas consumption that is, in the end, economic loss.

Since 2016 I work in A2A: the largest italian multiutiliy. In the ICT group my challenge is to improve the digitization of the processes connected with the production of energy. From design to maintenance, I follow all the evolutionary process of the software by improving and capturing all the business needs. I took a master degree in applied physics developing analytical skills and specializing in the field of renewable energies.
