### Unifying excellence in marine operations at Zamil Marine

Within Zamil Offshore we operate a fleet of 73 offshore support vessels in the Middle-East region. For these operations we have three main objectives: maximize compliance with client requirements, maximize operational excellence, and be fully in control of our fuel consumption and emissions. Hereby, we are dealing with the fact that the client requirements evolve over time and our fleet is not uniform nor standardized. To progress our growth we had to find ways to make the management and reporting of our operations uniform, scalable and agile for our whole fleet. We will discuss how we utilize the complementary strengths of both the PI System and Unified Operations Center (UOC). How we integrate and analyze our time series and business data, while monitoring and managing the resulting insights within our contextualized operations center.
