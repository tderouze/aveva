### Summary
Uniper SE, a power company, implemented a Maintenance Strategy Planning (MSP) tool leveraging the OSIsoft PI System and AVEVA(OSIsoft) to improve maintenance efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize asset utilization. The MSP tool digitalizes asset management processes, integrates historical, live, and forecast data, and provides a comprehensive view of equipment life, maintenance schedules, and risk profiles. A key component of Uniper's Digitalization@Generation program, this initiative resulted in a 16% reduction in CAPEX spend.

#### Challenges
High probability of errors when updating data manually, low frequency of data due to manual effort, expensive integrations with different systems.

#### Solution
One single connection from PI to our Atonyx Data Lake allowed us to get all the needed data in an accurate and almost live frequency. Using Asset Framework we can derive exact OH, starts (cold/warm/hot) for all relevant components.

#### Benefits
Next generation maintenance planning based on reliable and live data. Accurate historical & current data, Automatic updates & data flow, Allowed the implementation and successful use of the MSP tool group-wide via our enerlytics platform. The tool reduced our CAPEX spend by 16%!

Uniper started its 3-year Digitization journey in 2016. A major element of the program is the consistent and harmonized introduction of the OSIsoft PI System for our asset fleet. Now, 2/3 through the program, Uniper leverages the central availability of machine data to optimize its maintenance CAPEX budget and reduced it by 16% for 2019.
