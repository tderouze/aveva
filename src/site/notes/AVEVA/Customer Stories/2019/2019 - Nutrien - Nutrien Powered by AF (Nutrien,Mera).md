Nutrien, a merger between PotashCorp and Agrium, uses an Enterprise PI System to manage their operational data for the Potash Division. Utilization of the PI System has drastically expanded the implementation of PI AF. This presentation will expand on four key topics that have led to increased adoption: - Standardized PI tags organized in templates following a corporate hierarchy allows operational data to be easily accessed by all users leveraging PI Vision - Utilization of templates, proven analytics can be rapidly deployed across assets to share best practices - Leveraging the OSIsoft Partner Ecosystem, specialized solutions can be easily leveraged - Seeq and RtDuet - With the standards in place for PI tags, PI AF Elements, Templates and Hierarchy, Nutrien was able to quickly integrate an additional asset into the Potash Business Unit. The enterprise PI System has enabled operational data to be leveraged to address more complex operational opportunities.
