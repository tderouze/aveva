### Delivering Differentiated Business Value from the PI System Enabled NOV Max IIOT Platform

NOV has developed the Max IIOT platform, which enables large-scale collection, aggregation, and analytics of real-time equipment data. Leveraging these data and analytics capabilities enables significant improvements in performance and reductions in maintenance costs. In addition, NOV is using these technologies to build new digital product and service offerings including RigsentryTM, the 1st and only original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to be certified by both ABS and DNV-GL as an approved supplier of condition monitoring services for drilling and subsea equipment. The PI System is a key component of NOV's MaxTM technology stack in both an Enterprise Agreement (EA) and OEM hybrid commercial model. This presentation will provide an overview of NOV's transformation strategy, MaxTM, RigsentryTM, GoConnect and MaxTM Factory (the internal focus on leveraging MaxTM on internal NOV manufacturing and test facilities), and the role of the PI System.
