## Vistra Energy's Results

## Screenshots

Vistra Energy acquired Dynegy in 2018, creating a nationwide power generation fleet with leading positions in ERCOT, ISO-NE, PJM and MISO via 57 generation facilities. This presentation will describe how Vistra Energy onboarded the generation units into their existing monitoring and diagnostics center. This was made possible by leveraging asset framework templates, 9 experienced engineers and 30 college interns. At the end of the summer we had a fleet asset framework hierarchy, a Cloud based federated PI server, PI visions screens and ECG Predict-IT APR models based off the asset framework templates. Subsequently, the effort now shifts to standardizing the site PI ecosystem to create a more reliable, stable and low-touch environment. Utilizing Agile Project Management fundamentals, a small team will deliver value through improved communication, quicker planning cycles, and value-add solutions to site specific problems with a goal of enabling a Cloud migration of site PI servers.

Mike is a self-described reluctant technologist. His professional career was molded by the Lean practices he learned and implemented across various industries before joining Luminant Mining in 2009. After continual frustration at IT’s ability to deliver on-time results that met minimum standards, he joined the Vistra Technology team in 2014 to see how difficult it actually could be.
