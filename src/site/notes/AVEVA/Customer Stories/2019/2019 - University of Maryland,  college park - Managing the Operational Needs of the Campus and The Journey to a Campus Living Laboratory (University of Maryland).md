#### PRESENTATION

## 2019 - PI World - San Francisco - Academic Symposium

### Managing the Operational Needs of the Campus and The Journey to a Campus Living Laboratory (University of Maryland)

The University of Maryland partnered with NIST National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence to host the Situational Awareness Project and Energy Sector Asset Management Project. Leveraging the OSIsoft PI System, the Campus Co-generation Substation and 6,300 ton chiller plant was used as the test platform. Utilizing the newly centralized data, the university has realized improvements in billing accuracy and reliability, multi-system integration, infrastructure monitoring and outage alerts, and access to new data and visualizations to help transform the operations team from a reactive service model to an integrated, service management-focused organization. The team has further partnered with CITY@UMD, an academic unit with a focus on the study of different ventilation strategies, indoor thermal comfort, and indoor/outdoor building science validation studies which will allow the UMD College Park campus to become a Living Laboratory and a Smarter Sustainable City.

Jelena Srebric

Dr. Jelena Srebric is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering, where she teaches primarily graduate students and working in collaboration with the School of Architecture at the University of Maryland. She led the development of the new Cluster in Sustainability in the Built Environment. The cluster laboratory will feature an environmental chamber, and equipment for onsite energy monitoring, and occupant perception. Before coming to UMD, she was a Professor of Architectural Engineering and a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) for many years. There, she designed and built a state-of-the art environmental chamber facility at PSU for energy and indoor air quality studies. Prof. Srebric holds a Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in building technology, and M.S. and B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Belgrade. Her work is sponsored by several grants from the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation (NSF). She is a recipient of both NSF and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) career awards.
