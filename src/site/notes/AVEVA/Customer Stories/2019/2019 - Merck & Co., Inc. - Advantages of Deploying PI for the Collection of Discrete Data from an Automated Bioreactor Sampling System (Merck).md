### Advantages of Deploying PI for the Collection of Discrete Data from an Automated Bioreactor Sampling System (Merck)

Merck is an OSIsoft EA customer with PI deployed around the globe in research and manufacturing environments. Historically within Biologics Process Research and Development (BPRD), PI has been used heavily to capture continuous time series data from bioreactor controllers at multiple scales. A recent addition of Flownamics’ fully automated system for bioreactor sampling, analysis, and feed control provided an opportunity to integrate a substantial amount of discrete sample data into the PI system. This innovative use case enabled remote monitoring of all aspects of the cell culture process as well as provided a tool to monitor the system health of the auotsampler itself. This novel application of bringing discrete data from the autosampler to the PI system uses both PI Vision and PI AF. This work has resulted in key time savings on multiple fronts including: • visualization of current process performance • comparison to historical batches • remote monitoring of the system hea

Kristin O'Neill

Kristin is an Associate Principal Scientist in Merck & Co.'s Biologics Process Research and Development (BPRD) group located in Kenilworth, NJ. In various roles of increasing responsibility within BPRD, Kristin has experience in process development, pilot plant scale-up and operations, technology transfer for cGMP manufacturing, and supporting regulatory filings. Her work has spanned shake flasks, bench scale bioreactors, as well as pilot and commercial scale bioreactors through 12,000L using mammalian, yeast, and bacterial expression systems. Kristin has experience with traditional glass and stainless steel bioreactors, single-use and automated bioreactor platforms, and a wide variety of associated analytical instrumentation and automated sampling. Her current role is comprised of managing the day to day operations of a mammalian cell culture and microbial pilot plant, including leading the operations group, identifying and addressing bottlenecks to increase operational excellence, and leading engineering projects with a focus on new technology.
