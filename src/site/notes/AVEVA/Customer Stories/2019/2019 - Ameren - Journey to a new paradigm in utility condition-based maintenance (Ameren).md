## Ameren's Results

## Screenshots

National Security risks and the scope of catastrophic failures mean utility companies have been among the most conservative and aggressive with time-based maintenance. Thanks to new EPRI guidelines, utilities now have the chance to combine PI and continuous online machine health monitoring tools such as SmartDiagnostics® to reduce maintenance intervals and optimize machine performance.  This new approach is poised to dramatically shift the maintenance and reliability paradigms that utilities have followed for decades.  But are utility companies ready for this shift?  What are the implications of introducing new technology and data analytics into a traditional maintenance model? In this session you’ll learn how Ameren has already saved $798,000 by avoiding a plant down power and discovered ways to build a safer, more predictable utility plant.  See how PI is helping Maintenance and Reliability professionals optimize America’s utility infrastructure.
