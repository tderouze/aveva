### Summary
Toyota Motor Europe (TME) presented at PI World 2019 on their strategy to improve energy monitoring across their European manufacturing plants using AVEVA's PI System. The presentation highlighted the transition from disparate energy monitoring systems to a centralized system for better data accessibility, benchmarking, and reporting. The implementation involved connecting local plant systems to a central PI Server, enabling real-time analysis, trend analysis, and automated reporting. A pilot project was conducted to demonstrate the benefits of improved data access and visualization for various roles, including facility engineers, shop engineers, and plant management. Key learning points included ensuring data accuracy, investing in a robust Asset Framework, involving plant members, maintaining trained personnel, and gathering feedback from end-users to build effective delivery tools.

#### Challenges
No sufficient energy data flow from manufacturing plants and no standard for energy monitoring in manufacturing plants.

#### Solution
Implementing a centralized European framework and developing a plant size monitoring structure and roll-out in every plant.

#### Benefits
Hard benefits: Tangible energy reduction in pilot plant. Soft benefits: Empowering our engineers to take more efficient actions.

## Description
As a world leading automotive and mobility company, Toyota committed to preserve the environment and drive sustainability across the company and its supply-chain through an ambitious challenge targeting a global zero CO2 impact by 2050. A key point of our strategy is to manage and continuously optimize our manufacturing processes energy usage. The PI System is helping our teams to achieve this goal by collecting energy data along with production planning and weather data in our eight European manufacturing plants to better identify reduction opportunities. This talk will give an overview of how we use PI System in our daily activities, what are the main challenges we are dealing with, what has been accomplished so far and what we are planning as next steps on our way toward a carbon free business.
