#### PRESENTATION

## 2019 - PI World - San Francisco - Mining, Materials, Supply Chain

### Artificial Intelligence-enabled autonomous operations at CEMEX with Petuum Industrial AI Autopilot

CEMEX Manufacturing processes are concerned with quality, production costs from energy, fuels and materials and equipment efficiency, which in turn are often simultaneous tradeoffs, to be made in real time. Standardized repeatable processes easily replicated day after day, require understanding of process variables, forecasts and recommendations on changes that can be incorporated into workflows. CEMEX will show how companies working together created a data flow using PI infrastructure between plant control systems. CEMEX speakers will guide the audience on how actionable prescriptions in real-time for plant subsystems were validated and implemented into the operational control systems in supervised operations.
