This paper examines the efforts made to strengthen the management of real time data from our offshore legacy assets in PETRONAS & provide an assurance mechanism on data trustworthiness. It aims to share the experience in developing & operationalizing an in-house real time data reliability tool across 5 offshore fields in PETRONAS covering more than 100,000 data points. The pilot phase is still on-going, however preliminary results from this project is very encouraging. The project has begun contributing to higher data reliability & this is used as an indicator for further investment in digital operations.
