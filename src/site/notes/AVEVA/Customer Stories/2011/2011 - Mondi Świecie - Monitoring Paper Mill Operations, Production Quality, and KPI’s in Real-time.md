## 2011 - Regional Seminar - EMEA

### Monitoring Paper Mill Operations, Production Quality, and KPI’s in Real-time

Mondi Świecie S.A. is a Pulp and Paper mill located in the northern part of Poland with a yearly production of over 1.300.000 tons of paper. After the implementation of SAP, MES (Mill Execution System), and WMS (Warehouse Management System), there was a need for an infrastructure that could interface with these existing systems and provide production process data in real-time. OSIsoft’s PI System was a natural solution for our need to analyze and optimize our production processes. The original scope of the PI System implementation was limited to basic process data, but quickly grew into a company-wide infrastructure.
