## GenOn Energy's Results

This presentation will discuss the Proactive Maintenance Data Gateway (PMDG) implemented at Genon is based upon the Accenture Plant Performance Solution (APPS) using the PI System as its infrastructure. It correlates transactional and real time plant information involved in maintenance of critical equipment and systems. The project’s overall goal is to provide management, engineers and station personnel access to accurate plant and financial performance information needed to support operations and maintenance decisions in the most efficient manner. PMDG strategically integrates data collected from different plant systems such as real time data from the PI System, loss margin opportunity outage events, hand-held round information, and enterprise asset management transactional data. It then ties it to critical equipment to assess equipment health and potential financial consequences of failure. This interplay of information is providing GenOn personnel with transparency to equipment / system conditions while linking them to budget forecasts and financial performance drivers. The scope of this two-year project covers 20 stations, 5000 pieces of critical equipment, and 50 users.
