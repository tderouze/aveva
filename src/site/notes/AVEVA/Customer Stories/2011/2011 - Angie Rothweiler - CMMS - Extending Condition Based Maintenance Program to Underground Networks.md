### CMMS - Extending Condition Based Maintenance Program to Underground Networks

The calendar-based preventive maintenance & reactive corrective maintenance face challenges, i.e. no predictive maintenance strategy, significant liability risk and system outage potential from equipment failure, and limited assessment for determining asset condition and maintenance efficiency. PSE&G PI System based CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) provides the mechanism to address these challenges, shift maintenance activities from reactive to proactive through the integration from various data sources and the use of multiple-method condition monitoring and analysis. By utilizing the PI System analytics and visualization tools, PSE&G was able to transform the data into intelligence, and present it in a dashboard web portal form. The presentation will demonstrates the design and implementation of asset strategy, system configuration, condition assessment algorithms, and how the system leads to an integrated enterprise information center which enables concise decision making. Based on CMMS foundation and PI System infrastructure, PSE&G now has launched Underground Network Monitoring Project and Smart Grid Modernization Projects by utilizing the some advanced smart grid technologies to further achieve measurable improvements in reliability for underground cables, underground network assets and distribution operations.
