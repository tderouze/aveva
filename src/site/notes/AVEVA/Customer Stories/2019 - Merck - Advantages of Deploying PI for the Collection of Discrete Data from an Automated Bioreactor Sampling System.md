## Description
Merck is an OSIsoft EA customer with PI deployed around the globe in research and manufacturing environments. Historically within Biologics Process Research and Development (BPRD), PI has been used heavily to capture continuous time series data from bioreactor controllers at multiple scales. A recent addition of Flownamics’ fully automated system for bioreactor sampling, analysis, and feed control provided an opportunity to integrate a substantial amount of discrete sample data into the PI system. This innovative use case enabled remote monitoring of all aspects of the cell culture process as well as provided a tool to monitor the system health of the auotsampler itself. This novel application of bringing discrete data from the autosampler to the PI system uses both PI Vision and PI AF. This work has resulted in key time savings on multiple fronts including: • visualization of current process performance • comparison to historical batches • remote monitoring of the system hea
