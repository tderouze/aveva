## Description
As a world leading automotive and mobility company, Toyota committed to preserve the environment and drive sustainability across the company and its supply-chain through an ambitious challenge targeting a global zero CO2 impact by 2050. A key point of our strategy is to manage and continuously optimize our manufacturing processes energy usage. The PI System is helping our teams to achieve this goal by collecting energy data along with production planning and weather data in our eight European manufacturing plants to better identify reduction opportunities. This talk will give an overview of how we use PI System in our daily activities, what are the main challenges we are dealing with, what has been accomplished so far and what we are planning as next steps on our way toward a carbon free business.
