The wiring within an unmanned aircraft is like the nervous system of the human body. Maintaining the quality of the wire cabling assemblies to deliver instantaneous commands to the various flight systems is of the utmost importance for safety and delivering mission objectives. The PI System allows us to to monitor the manufacturing process and devices used to deliver the final product. PI Event Frames, PI Vision, PI Manual Logger and receiving automated health status notifications of the Modbus sensor equipment uncover previously unseen information that help us achieve this goal.
