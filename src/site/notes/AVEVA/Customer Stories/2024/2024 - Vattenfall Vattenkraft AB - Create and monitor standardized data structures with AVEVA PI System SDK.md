### Summary
Vattenfall Hydro Nordic, a major European electricity producer, overcame challenges related to its aging, geographically dispersed AVEVA PI System by implementing an SDK-driven solution. This involved standardizing data structures using custom scripts for AF structure creation and PI Point naming. Benefits included increased efficiency, improved data quality, and the enablement of fleet-wide analysis and Condition Based Monitoring.

---
#### Challenges
Vattenfall Hydro Nordic faced challenges with its AVEVA PI System due to its age, geographically spread-out nature with a strong local focus, and a shift from technician-centric use to analyst-centric use. The old PI System structure was built up over a long time. The varied fleet of powerplants built from 1910 to the 1980s was also challenging. Historically, the PI System has been used as a monitoring tool for technicians with a primary focus on local connections between measurement values and equipment. There was an increasing demand for analysis, including production statistics, predictive maintenance, weather and hydrology forecasting, environmental reporting, investment planning, and root cause analysis.

#### Solution
Vattenfall Hydro Nordic addressed these challenges by creating SDK scripts to create a well-templatized AF structure, PI Point naming conventions, and to ensure fleet-wide comparable data quality. They standardized their AF structure with 150 turbines and 40,000 PI Points using the AVEVA PI System SDK. They used .NET but wrappable in Python. Inspired by the package PIConnect. The SDK script was used to generate the entire template structure, which is templatized for easy setup of PI Vision displays using a referenced template structure, enabling roll-out updates on all turbines. They also used the SDK for PI Point renaming using a mixture of language and AI models, generating descriptions to couple the point to the actual equipment, and data analysis, data transfer to the cloud, healing faulty data, and combining after sensor switches.

#### Benefits
The implementation of the SDK-based solution resulted in several benefits, including increased capacity for the PI System team to support new business cases, improved efficiency in developing and maintaining PI AF templates, reduced implementation time for new sensors, enabled fleet-wide analysis and comparisons, and enabled the use of Condition Based Monitoring (CBM) within the organization. The outcome enabled Condition Based Monitoring, simplified the setup of new analysis, showed increased maintenance costs in the fleet due to new production patterns, and enabled gap analysis to identify stations lacking important features.

### Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB: Create and monitor standardized data structures with AVEVA PI System SDK

Vattenfall Hydro Nordic has a rich history with AVEVA PI System, which has been the backbone of data collection for hydro power plants.  Vattenfall is committed to sustainability and innovation, which requires reliable and efficient data management across its diverse energy portfolio.  Over the years, the system has transitioned from being a local governance tool to a centralized platform for Condition-Based Maintenance and fleet usage optimization.  This shift has necessitated the standardization of data, naming conventions, and Asset Framework structures to support the evolving needs. These developments reflect Vattenfall's commitment to leveraging AVEVA PI System not just as a monitoring tool, but as an integrated component of its daily operations, driving efficiency and optimization across its hydro power plant fleet. It has been crucial to fulfill the demands of different users, such as technicians, analysts, and management.  Each group has unique requirements and perspectives that must be considered to ensure the system's effectiveness and relevance.­ The journey with AVEVA PI System has provided valuable lessons from a decade of hands-on experience.  It has highlighted the critical role of standards and the need for close collaboration between local technicians and global analysts.  The SDK helps Vattenfall standardize and automate the creation of AF structures and PI Point names in a templated and automated way, reducing manual errors and enhancing data quality.  The SDK is also used to vigilantly monitoring of data structure and quality.  In this presentation, we will share with you our journey with AVEVA PI System and the lessons learned from 10 years of experience.  We will cover the following topics: The importance of standards and collaboration between technicians working locally and analysts working globally Our usage of the SDK to scale templatized AF structures and PI Point naming Monitoring of the data structure and quality

From Automotive to Hydropower I have always been fascinated by machines and how they work. That is why I decided to study Mechanical Engineering at Luleå University of Technology. After graduating, I got a job in the Automotive Industry, where I learned a lot about Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), Toyota Way and Lean Manufacturing. I was involved in collecting and analyzing data from production machines, using it to calculate Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and identify root causes of problems. I enjoyed working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, where I could apply my engineering skills and knowledge. After four years in the Automotive Industry. I was interested in renewable energy and how it could contribute to a more sustainable future. I got a job in the solar cell industry, where I worked on developing the production process and its efficiency. We produced our own solar modules and applied Lean principles to ensure quality and efficiency. I learned a lot about the technology and the challenges of the renewable energy sector.  For the past 15 years, I have been working at Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB, a company that operates in hydropower. Hydropower is one of the most reliable and clean sources of energy, and I am proud to be part of a company that is committed to producing electricity from renewable sources. I have been able to use my previous experiences and skills in the hydropower sector, as well as learn new things all the time. I have been working on monitoring and optimizing their performance. I also start to use AI to analyze data and predict potential issues and solutions. I find my job very rewarding and challenging, as I get to work on projects that have a positive impact on the environment and society. In my spare time, I like to be out in nature, mainly on skis. I love cross-country skiing, and I am also a coach for a local ski club. I enjoy teaching and inspiring young people to pursue their passion and develop their skills. I have three children who are also athletes, and I support them in their endeavors. I believe that sports and physical activity are important for health and well-being, as well as for developing discipline and teamwork. I try to balance my work and personal life, and I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that I have had in my career and life.
