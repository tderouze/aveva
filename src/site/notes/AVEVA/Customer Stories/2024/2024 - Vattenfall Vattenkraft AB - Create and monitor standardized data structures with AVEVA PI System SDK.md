### Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB: Create and monitor standardized data structures with AVEVA PI System SDK

Vattenfall Hydro Nordic has a rich history with AVEVA PI System, which has been the backbone of data collection for hydro power plants.  Vattenfall is committed to sustainability and innovation, which requires reliable and efficient data management across its diverse energy portfolio.  Over the years, the system has transitioned from being a local governance tool to a centralized platform for Condition-Based Maintenance and fleet usage optimization.  This shift has necessitated the standardization of data, naming conventions, and Asset Framework structures to support the evolving needs. These developments reflect Vattenfall's commitment to leveraging AVEVA PI System not just as a monitoring tool, but as an integrated component of its daily operations, driving efficiency and optimization across its hydro power plant fleet. It has been crucial to fulfill the demands of different users, such as technicians, analysts, and management.  Each group has unique requirements and perspectives that must be considered to ensure the system's effectiveness and relevance.­ The journey with AVEVA PI System has provided valuable lessons from a decade of hands-on experience.  It has highlighted the critical role of standards and the need for close collaboration between local technicians and global analysts.  The SDK helps Vattenfall standardize and automate the creation of AF structures and PI Point names in a templated and automated way, reducing manual errors and enhancing data quality.  The SDK is also used to vigilantly monitoring of data structure and quality.  In this presentation, we will share with you our journey with AVEVA PI System and the lessons learned from 10 years of experience.  We will cover the following topics: The importance of standards and collaboration between technicians working locally and analysts working globally Our usage of the SDK to scale templatized AF structures and PI Point naming Monitoring of the data structure and quality

From Automotive to Hydropower I have always been fascinated by machines and how they work. That is why I decided to study Mechanical Engineering at Luleå University of Technology. After graduating, I got a job in the Automotive Industry, where I learned a lot about Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), Toyota Way and Lean Manufacturing. I was involved in collecting and analyzing data from production machines, using it to calculate Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and identify root causes of problems. I enjoyed working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, where I could apply my engineering skills and knowledge. After four years in the Automotive Industry. I was interested in renewable energy and how it could contribute to a more sustainable future. I got a job in the solar cell industry, where I worked on developing the production process and its efficiency. We produced our own solar modules and applied Lean principles to ensure quality and efficiency. I learned a lot about the technology and the challenges of the renewable energy sector.  For the past 15 years, I have been working at Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB, a company that operates in hydropower. Hydropower is one of the most reliable and clean sources of energy, and I am proud to be part of a company that is committed to producing electricity from renewable sources. I have been able to use my previous experiences and skills in the hydropower sector, as well as learn new things all the time. I have been working on monitoring and optimizing their performance. I also start to use AI to analyze data and predict potential issues and solutions. I find my job very rewarding and challenging, as I get to work on projects that have a positive impact on the environment and society. In my spare time, I like to be out in nature, mainly on skis. I love cross-country skiing, and I am also a coach for a local ski club. I enjoy teaching and inspiring young people to pursue their passion and develop their skills. I have three children who are also athletes, and I support them in their endeavors. I believe that sports and physical activity are important for health and well-being, as well as for developing discipline and teamwork. I try to balance my work and personal life, and I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that I have had in my career and life.
