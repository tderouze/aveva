## 2024 - AVEVA World - Paris - O&G Energy Transition

### Parkland: Accelerating the Transition to Low Carbon Fuels with Advanced Visualization and Layers of Analytics with Integrated AI

To support Canada’s transition to net zero, the Parkland Burnaby refinery located in British Columbia (BC), has and continues to lead in the coprocessing of renewables feedstocks consisting of tallow, canola oil, and paper and pulp waste products in their FCCU to produce low carbon gasoline and diesel supporting their goal 30% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030. The co-processing of renewable feedstocks and the associated operational challenges is underpinned by AVEVA products such as Enterprise SCADA and the PI System with an advanced use of PI AF for descriptive, and diagnostic analytics. Using a “layers of analytics” approach, PI AF streaming analytics are bi-directionally integrated with Seeq, an AVEVA partner, and machine learning with infused AI in an AWS environment, Parkland Refining is accelerating the ability to both process and optimize co-processing in their FCCU and refinery. To further support the ability to “push the co-processing envelope”, Parkland Refining has engaged an AVEVA CONNECT partner, IOTA, for advanced integration and industrial visualization using IOTA Visual Unified Environment (VUE). This presentation will be structured in a challenge-solution-results flow and provide an overview of Parkland Refining’s use of AVEVA solutions in their co-processing journey to produce low carbon transportation fuels while reducing the refinery’s energy and carbon intensity. Of particular focus will be the heavy use of PI AF as a foundation to advanced analytics with infused AI and advanced industrial visualization.
