### Tecnimont: A key player for the digital transformation of engineering processes

Tecnimont chose AVEVA Engineering because the software proved to be flexible and adaptable to various engineering requests during different project design phases. Initially, Tecnimont used the software to define a Mechanical List. The first outcome was to always have engineering documentation ready, matching the customer's expectations, updated with the inputs from the disciplines tracked and controlled. With more daily effort to gather information, the time to prepare the Equipment List document was cut by 80 percent. Then Tecnimont expanded the AVEVA Engineering use to include Process data, followed by the Electrical Consumer list, and so on, all without relying on a predefined data model. This flexibility facilitated the tool's adoption across various departments, allowing it to respond to requests promptly. Items in different lists that used to be separate and only manually synced, were automatically linked to prevent repeated information and make sure they followed naming rules and didn't overlap. With more daily work to deal with coordination and compliance issues, having a reliable database when deadlines approached helped them meet the deadlines and reduced 50 percent of the time usually spent on fixing inconsistencies and discrepancies. As a result of the proven reliability, the software's use was extended to Procurement by sending items to SAP for purchase. The solution was applied in the engineering stage of the big projects that Tecnimont carried out in the recent years. Now, Tecnimont aims to tackle new challenges and leverage the enhanced capabilities of the product by moving to phase 2: Standardisation. This phase involves integrating the previously used data model and relevant lists into a broader model provided by AVEVA, which includes de facto standards such as CIFHOS. Additionally, Tecnimont plans to implement a comprehensive Naming Convention and utilize key functionalities, particularly the Reclassification of objects, which is highly beneficial during the engineering phase. The aim is to achieve, without major changes to the company's established work processes, a project database that follows the global standards of data representation and sharing.
