### Schmidt Group: Decision support at the heart of Manufacturing

Schmidt Group is the industrial leader in custom-made furniture manufacturing.  Lean value has been central to our operating culture for over 30 years.  The use of AI for real-time bottleneck identification has allowed us to improve the OEE of the line by 4 points.  The object-oriented approach of the AVEVA PI System enabled simple deployment, and furthermore, opened doors to other opportunities within the company. Schmidt is now integrating energy performance topics, to reduce our impact on the planet.  Our ambition is to add intelligence modules similar to the one already in place, fueled by the learnings we acquired during the scaling up of the solution.

Patrick Viry

Patrick Viry. The 49-year-old graduated from an engineering school with a degree in electrical engineering and began his career automating installations in the bottling industry. After 8 exciting years allowing him to discover the wine regions of France, he moved from wine to cooking by joining Schmidt Groupe in 2008. He supported the group in the construction, renovation and maintenance of highly automated production lines. The company's highly digital production concept allows it to produce more than 5000 pieces of furniture per unit daily with a level of automation of serial lines. In 2020, the transformation division was created within its teams to implement the disruptions that allow the company to meet its development needs but also CSR challenges. The family business, recently certified BCorp, will rely on digital technology to meet these needs.
