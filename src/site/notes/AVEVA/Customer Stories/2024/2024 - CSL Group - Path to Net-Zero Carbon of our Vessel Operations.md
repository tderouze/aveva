Jean-Frederic Lavoie

Over 15 years at sea on commercial vessel; 6 of which as a Chief Engineer. Moved ashore to pursue my career as Fleet Superintendent for VShips for about 5 years.  Moved to the Special Project for CSL Group. My first project was to connect the vessels, extract the data, develop our Digital Twin, design the backhand structure and prove the value on 2 trial vessels using the PI System. Project went ahead, so I became in charge of installing, deploying and finding the value across our fleet of vessels. Now the PI system is installed on 40 vessels with ongoing installations on our new builds and acquisitions. Still overseeing new installations. But also, in charge of O2; O2 being short for Operational Optimizer. This means finding the value in the data, provide solutions and ideas on how to retrieve the value. Finally assuring that the solution evolves as it should and is well-integrated with our business processes.
