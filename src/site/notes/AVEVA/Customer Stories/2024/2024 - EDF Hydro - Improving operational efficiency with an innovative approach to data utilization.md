### EDF Hydro: Improving operational efficiency with an innovative approach to data utilization

As the demand for renewable electricity grows, EDF Hydro faced increased demand from users for access to AVEVA PI System asset framework (AF) models, which in turn placed a growing burden on the administration team. In response, EDF created an innovative PI Utility tool – using standard Web API and SDK components – that gives users the ability to deploy AF models without needing admin rights or direct access to the underlying PI System. Acting like a swiss knife, the new multipurpose utility tool removes the technical barriers for operators, allowing them to quickly and easily deploy AF calculations and models without worrying about the technical aspects. With data and models now standardized across the business, EDF Hydro can use the time and money saved to integrate more advanced applications such as AVEVA Predictive Analytics to help ensure the continuous supply of sustainable, reliable electricity across France.
