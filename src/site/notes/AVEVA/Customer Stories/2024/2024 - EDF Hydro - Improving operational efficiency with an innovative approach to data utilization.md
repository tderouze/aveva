### Summary
EDF Hydro, a leading net-zero electricity producer, enhanced its operational efficiency by developing PI Utility, a web application leveraging the AVEVA PI System. This innovation addressed challenges in deploying AF templates, generating asset hierarchies, and extending PI System functionalities, resulting in significant time savings and improved data management.

#### Challenges
EDF Hydro faced challenges in efficiently deploying AF template instances, automatically generating AF hierarchies from asset repositories, and extending AVEVA PI System features. The manual deployment process was time-consuming, requiring significant effort and coordination.

#### Solution
EDF Hydro developed PI Utility, a web application built on .Net 8 (C#, Blazor Server) and Microsoft SQL Server, integrated with EDF Hydro's asset repositories and the AVEVA PI System. This tool automated the AF template deployment process, enabled automatic generation of AF hierarchies, and provided extended PI System functionalities.

#### Benefits
The implementation of PI Utility resulted in an 80% reduction in the time required to deploy AF models, increased agility and efficiency, reduced human errors, and facilitated seamless addition of new features. 92 AF models and almost 16K AF template instances were deployed in production.

### EDF Hydro: Improving operational efficiency with an innovative approach to data utilization

As the demand for renewable electricity grows, EDF Hydro faced increased demand from users for access to AVEVA PI System asset framework (AF) models, which in turn placed a growing burden on the administration team. In response, EDF created an innovative PI Utility tool – using standard Web API and SDK components – that gives users the ability to deploy AF models without needing admin rights or direct access to the underlying PI System. Acting like a swiss knife, the new multipurpose utility tool removes the technical barriers for operators, allowing them to quickly and easily deploy AF calculations and models without worrying about the technical aspects. With data and models now standardized across the business, EDF Hydro can use the time and money saved to integrate more advanced applications such as AVEVA Predictive Analytics to help ensure the continuous supply of sustainable, reliable electricity across France.
