Agnico Eagle is leveraging CONNECT in collaboration with Databricks to drive cutting-edge data science initiatives, with a primary focus on optimizing fuel utilization for their mobile fleet. In this presentation, they will explore how they applied machine learning algorithms to vehicle telemetry data, uncovering critical links between fuel consumption, motor statistics, and high-cost equipment failures. By automating data flows through CONNECT data services, Agnico Eagle has achieved a scalable, resilient data engineering framework, which accelerates the iteration process in their fuel analytics projects. As a part of their lighthouse engagement with AVEVA, they will also share insights into how CONNECT’s advanced visualization and analytics tools have enhanced their project, showcasing how this innovative approach has driven measurable success in fleet management and operational efficiency.
