## Challenge-Solution-Benefit
### Summary
Michelin, a discrete manufacturing company, partnered with AVEVA to develop an intelligent, data-driven energy management system. The system addresses challenges related to data standardization, processing large data volumes, and accessibility of energy consumption data. By utilizing AVEVA PI Server and Asset Framework, combined with Michelin's Mapib solution, they achieved standardized data, cloud processing, and a mobile app for easy access. This resulted in energy savings, improved productivity, and progress toward sustainability, with energy consumption data availability for teams.

#### Challenges
Michelin faced challenges in standardizing energy data from multiple sources for use outside of operations, processing huge amounts of data, and making energy consumption monitoring accessible to everyone in the company.

#### Solution
Michelin used AVEVA PI Server and Asset Framework, combined with their own solution (Mapib), to read, standardize, and contextualize data from each counter. They processed data in the cloud and exposed it in a standard way for users. A mobile app was also developed to provide quick and easy data access.

#### Benefits
Michelin progresses toward sustainability with standardized data in the cloud across 8,000 counters and 15 sites, accessible to all employees for monitoring, and benchmarking between machines from different sites for central teams, reduce energy Consumption and CO2 Footprint
