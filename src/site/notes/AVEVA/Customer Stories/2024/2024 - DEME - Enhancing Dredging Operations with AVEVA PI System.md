### DEME: Enhancing Dredging Operations with AVEVA PI System

In the demanding field of dredging; making informed and effective real-time decisions is crucial to achieving operational success.  In this presentation, we explore how DEME leveraged the AVEVA PI System software to enhance operational performance on a recent, complex, multi-vessel dredging project.  This was done by integrating data from various vessels into a cohesive and user-friendly dashboard, DEME empowered orchestration and collaboration between its crews and project engineers to monitor operations in real-time to make well-informed, data-driven decisions.  This innovative approach not only optimized our operational processes; but also significantly boosted project efficiency and profitability. Join us to discover how DEME's application of advanced data visualization tools, set new benchmarks in dredging project management.
