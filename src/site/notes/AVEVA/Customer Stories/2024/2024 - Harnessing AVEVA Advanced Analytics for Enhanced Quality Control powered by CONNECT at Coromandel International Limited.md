### Harnessing AVEVA Advanced Analytics for Enhanced Quality Control powered by CONNECT at Coromandel International Limited

This presentation will summarize how Coromandel, an Indian agrochemical manufacturing company, has benefitted from the integration of AVEVA PI System with CONNECT services for cloud data management and advanced analytics to deploy an advanced AI/ML algorithm to predict and improve production quality. We will focus on four current and critical use cases: Nutrient prediction for N-P-K (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium) fertilizer Prediction of phosphorous pentoxide (P205) fertilizer loss in gypsum Free acid prediction in the reactor to improve rock efficiency Cost savings analysis based on weak vs strong acid utilization These initiatives aim to improve Coromandel's efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure consistent product quality.
