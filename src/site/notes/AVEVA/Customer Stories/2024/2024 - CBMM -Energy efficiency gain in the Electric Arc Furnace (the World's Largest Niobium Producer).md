## 2024 - AVEVA World - Paris - Process Industries (Chemicals, MMM, Pulp/Paper)

### CBMM: Energy efficiency gain in the Electric Arc Furnace (the World's Largest Niobium Producer)

Implement, standardize, and manage the power curves of the dephosphorization furnaces at CBMM in Araxa, Minas Gerais. The project utilizes existing AVEVA assets to ensure process safety, adherence to quality parameters, and standardize energy consumption for furnace operations. Initially, a pilot project was implemented on Furnace 2 (FE02), with Furnaces 1 and 3 currently in the rollout phase.

Amanda Branco

Nice to meet you, I am Amanda! I have a degree in Chemical Engineering from the Federal University of Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro and currently serve as a Production Engineer at the largest niobium technology company in the world. Throughout my professional journey, I have sought to learn about different areas of the market. I had the opportunity to intern in various niches, which prepared me to be a multidisciplinary and flexible professional. As an engineer, I have been working for over 2 years in the Mining and Metallurgy sector, having participated from the start in projects with a significant impact on the company. In my first year, I was primarily responsible for developing a project focused on reducing water resource consumption across the entire industrial unit (about 15 plants), a project based on the internal needs of the company in line with ESG principles. I took the opportunity to build a vast network with leaders across the company since the project spanned several areas beyond Industrial, such as Logistics and Supply, Engineering, and Market Intelligence. From my second year onwards, my focus has been on production management at one of the company's Metallurgical plants. I am primarily responsible for identifying and leading continuous improvement projects in the area through methodologies such as SDCA, PDCA, DMAIC, and Kaizen. I collaborate with various departments during project execution, highlighting the Industrial Technology team. I also manage the main Production and Safety KPIs along with other area leaders. I serve in an indirect leadership role over a team of more than 50 people, being the main technical support for the area. I find it easy to work with data, with Microsoft Excel and Minitab being my strong suits. I am interested in economics, finance, and investments, and I am currently pursuing an MBA in Asset Management and Capital Markets at Faculdade Hub. Given my background, I highlight that I am quick to learn and communicate, characteristics that help me continually develop and achieve good results in my commitments. I am proactive and enjoy working in environments with a diversity of people and ideas. I am described as a disciplined and committed person. I am also said to be empathetic, fun, and laid-back during leisure moments. In my personal life, I am always in constant motion, with physical exercise being my main hobby. Additionally, I fill my free time with music, reading, and quality moments with my family and friends.
