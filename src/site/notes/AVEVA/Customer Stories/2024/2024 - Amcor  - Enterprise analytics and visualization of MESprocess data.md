### Amcor: Enterprise analytics and visualization of MES/process data

Amcor utilizes blow molding and injection molding processes to manufacture rigid plastics (think about clear plastic food containers). Amcor worked on a Lighthouse engagement with AVEVA to optimize the effectiveness of their processes. This includes the use of MES and process data stored on CONNECT data services, which is displayed in CONNECT data visualization and processed with AVEVA Advanced Analytics tool. This allows Amcor to utilize upstream data from the polymer blending process, address performance/downtime issues with molders, and look across molding machines for process variances.
