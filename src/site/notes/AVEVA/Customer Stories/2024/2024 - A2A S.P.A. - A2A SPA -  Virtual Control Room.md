#### Challenges
A2A faced the challenge of managing an increasing number of renewable energy plants (wind and solar) that produce less energy individually compared to a smaller number of larger plants. This shift in the production paradigm, coupled with different systems and segregated data across various plant types, created complexity in monitoring and control.

#### Solution
A2A deployed AVEVA Unified Operation Center to centralize data collection, enable real-time analysis, and streamline control across its renewable energy plants.

#### Benefits
The implementation of AVEVA's solution provided A2A with a unique real-time monitoring tool and remote control capabilities, leading to centralized information, simplified management, increased scalability and responsiveness to market changes, and integrated reporting. It also facilitated the proposal of Machine Learning initiatives for data correlations.

## Description
The Virtual Control Room is a project realized by A2A in collaboration with Factory Software and Alten to manage the entire Renewables Power Plants of the company, with the aim of monitoring and controlling the renewable power production of the company.

The system is composed of various parts, from OT to IT, and allows real-time and near real-time data availability and usability of data from all plants. It enables operation and remote control, as well as monitoring, by uniting and simplifying the work of the remote control operators and asset managers, who are more focused on analysis and problem-solving. For each plant, both photovoltaic and wind, operators can monitor production, efficiency, availability and downtime, as well as detect anomalies and trends or situations that need to be managed such as parameters that deviate from expected range.

The virtual control room platform has been implemented on the AVEVA System Platform (UOC) and currently manages about a hundred photovoltaic and wind plants, retrieving thousands of tags from the field. It is designed to support all future growth and additional renewable plants.
