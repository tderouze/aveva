### ENGIE: Introduction to Robin – the AVEVA PI System for asset monitoring and a use case on vibration monitoring

ENGIE’s purpose is to act to accelerate the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy, through reduced energy consumption and more environmentally friendly solutions. ENGIE has reshaped its portfolio of assets and build an organization to be the leader in the energy transition. Digitalization is an important lever to achieve our goals and we use data to make better decisions, be more agile and transparent. ENGIE has created a data historian platform called Robin that is based on AVEVA PI System. Robin is connected to assets from all over the world and from different types such as power plants, gas terminals, distribution networks, renewable assets, batteries, etc. The real-time data collected from these assets is used to improve their performance, reduce emissions, increase the availability and help with the valorization of the assets. Over time, ENGIE has developed a library of asset models and analytics on Robin to support these goals. The latest and greatest addition to Robin is an application for Vibration monitoring on large shafts of its thermal power plants. This solution is based on AVEVA PI System and offers a series of functionalities for operators in the control rooms and vibration experts.
