## Description
Cargill is one of the largest privately held businesses in the world, with a diverse portfolio ranging from Agriculture and Food to Industrial and Financial businesses. Working across so many varied businesses means standardization can be a challenge. Cargill wants to share how localized efforts in the use of PI AF, Event Frames, and Data Link can lead to new insights that drive tangible action to improve pack line productivity. In many Cargill facilities, downtime is tracked for events greater than 1 minute and sites record context around these events. But what about micro stops? During daily production meetings,one facility consistently tracked micro stops as a top contributor to production loss. As a result, the site utilized PI Event Frames to gain more granular insight to those losses and drive the team from a reactive to a proactive culture. This talk will take you through the journey of solution implementation, quantifying the data, the findings and the value realized.

**Challenge:**
- The production line was losing 40 hours a month in productivity due to micro-stops
- All performance loss data was grouped together, making it difficult to analyze

**Solution:**
- Optimize the performance of its oil filling plant by tracking events in the PI System
- Visualize information in the PI System in order to see data in a relational way

**Benefits:**
- Loss was reduced from 20-40 hours per month to just eight
- Cargill easily replicates the value of the PI System across its facilities
- New PI System users taught to visualize and analyze information in just two hours
