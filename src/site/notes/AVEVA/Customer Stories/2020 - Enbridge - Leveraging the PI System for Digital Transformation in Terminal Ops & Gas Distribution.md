## Description
Enbridge Liquids - Leveraging PI Asset Framework in Terminal Operations: One of the most challenging optimization problems in a pipeline system is terminal operations. The combination of tanks, manifolds, pumps, and meters can lead to almost unlimited combinations. These combinations make everything, from planning maintenance to operational analysis, significantly harder, if not impossible. In 2018, the new OSIsoft PI System which included PI Asset Framework (AF) was installed. The additional functionality has allowed significant new insights into our terminals and its operations. Operational analysis, which previously took weeks, can now be conducted in hours. The project was focused on four (4) key variables at the Kerrobert Terminal: • Improve Risk Based Inspection by highlighting low usage piping • Knowing when a pipe has not seen operations in the last 365 days • Understand the usage of terminal piping to better inform maintenance planning based on criticality • Improve our understanding of the operating conditions of each flow path for operational event analysis Enbridge Gas - Digitization and Visualization using the PI System in Gas Distribution: Enbridge Gas delivers safe, reliable service to more than 3.7 million residential, commercial, institutional and industrial customers in Ontario and Quebec. However, monitoring the complex SCADA system in the field is challenging. But with PI Asset Framework and data virtualization, we can make abstract data easy to understand, gain more insights from data, as well as share information across the enterprise. This presentation covers the integration of the PI System into the existing SCADA network, rapid deployment of PI Vision screens by using PI Vision extensibility features, as well as leveraging the IT Infrastructure for more efficient data sharing.
