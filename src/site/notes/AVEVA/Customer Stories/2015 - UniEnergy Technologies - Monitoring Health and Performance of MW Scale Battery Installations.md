## Description
As UniEnergy Technologies (UET) deployed its first commercial, grid-scale energy storage systems, we simultaneously created a defined data structure and analyses for our systems in the PI System using the PI Server and PI Asset Framework (PI AF). This data fed into a full suite of displays, notifications, and reports in PI Coresight and PI DataLink. The PI Clients are used to monitor the health and performance of each deployed battery as it is used for unique applications by a variety of customers. Health indicators inform preventative maintenance activities and performance indicators give our customers' insight into optimizing charge/discharge operations.

In order to monitor the numerous batteries to be deployed in the field, the PI System data is aggregated into key health and performance indicators in weekly reports automatically using PI DataLink and Excel. Each one-page weekly health report shows data and graphs for major health indicators for each battery subsystem and aggregates that information into a single, weekly, health statistic for the subsystem. Baselines for all process data and their dependence on operational variables is established during manufacturing and commissioning tests and referenced by PI DataLink analyses in each weekly health report. Weekly performance reports compare battery performance during charge and discharge quarter-cycles and frequency regulation activities to the baseline performance. Each partial charge/discharge will give an indication of overall performance and insights for operational optimization.

For health indicators more urgent than weekly, but not so urgent as to cause control loop intervention, PI Notifications will be used. This middle tier of urgency relies on simpler formulas stored in PI AF that don't require statistical comparison to that signal's baseline or its behavior over time. PI Coresight displays are used for in-depth analysis of issues discovered through the health reports and for the intense scrutiny required for quality control during manufacturing tests."
