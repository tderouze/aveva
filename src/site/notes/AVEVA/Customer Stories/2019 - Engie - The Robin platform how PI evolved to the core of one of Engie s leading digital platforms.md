## Description
Since 2006, PI went through an organizational and functional evolution within Engie's Business Unit Generation Europe (BU Gen). As of 2017, the PI infrastructure has been further consolidated on a private cloud and was branded as ROBIN. It is considered one of Engie s leading OT platforms. The strategic choice to host all BU Gen applications on the same private cloud accelerated the deployment of satellite apps that orbit around ROBINs PI-based core to fulfill specific business needs: displaying real-time asset status, performing inspection rounds, checking equipment safety and logging operational events. A standardized approach for using PI, AF, Analytics and PI Vision in a joint effort with subject matter experts lead to the creation of condition monitoring and performance calculation modules. Currently other subsidiaries of the Engie group are adopting the ROBIN platform thanks to the flexibility, functionality, scale of PI and the service provided by our in-house competence center.
