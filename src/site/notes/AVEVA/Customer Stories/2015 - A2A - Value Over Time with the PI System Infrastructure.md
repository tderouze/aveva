## Description
a2a is the biggest multi-utility in Italy operating in power generation, heat distribution, waste-to-energy, and networks. One of its divisions, Edipower, started using the PI System several years ago for real-time data gathering and it has helped operate the plant more efficiently. Since then the PI System Infrastructure has been evolving and increased its adoption and usage in areas such as quality, energy management and operation management. The PI Server implementation has also increased, first installed in thermo power plants and now in idro power plants and waste recycling plants.

a2a uses a corporate PI Server at HQ to gather, transform and manage data from intra-company PI Servers located at plant level across a secure channel and according to a2a security standards. Corporate web-portal based on Microsoft SharePoint and OSIsoft PI WebParts were implemented to visualize the information in a web environment. The PI Client tools allow creation of specific displays to monitor real-time fine chemicals consumption as required by regulations. This allow the operators to make informed decision and calculate adjustments to the heat loading of the turbine generator (which translates into megawatts of power and therefore increased in revenue); instead of making excessively large load reductions to ensure permit compliance at the expense of lost revenue. Furthermore PI Coresight and html 5 made it possible to monitor the plants via a mobile smartphone and tablet. "
