### Vir Biotechnology & Cognizant: RAPID Lab & Timeseries Data - CONNECT data services implementation

Vir Biotechnology is a mid-cap biotechnology company applying its platforms towards treatments and cures for infectious diseases, immunologic conditions, and oncology therapeutics. Current high-resolution cell culture bioreactor data is not systematically retrievable limiting the application of advanced analytics and visualization including existing ML/AI tools designed to accelerate commercialization through process optimization. Ensuring these process data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) are critical to enabling machine learning and other advanced analytical approaches. Users spend an estimated 30% of their project time finding, cleaning, formatting, and duplicating data for every study performed. Automatic acquisition and data view sharing is expected to halve the time spent on analysis and reporting while reducing the chance of errors during data duplication for reporting purposes. Vir Biotechnology's strategy for cloud-first employee workplace experience and track-record of successful distributed manufacturing relies on an extensive R&D and IT partnership to maximize productivity of limited resources. Vir Biotechnology established a partnership with Cognizant to implement a cloud-first data historian strategy using AVEVA's SaaS offering, CONNECT Data Services (CDS). AVEVA Adapter for OPC UA was configured in a failover setup to ingress process development data into CDS. Data infrastructure without ever having an operating on-premises PI Server was implemented. CDS serves as an essential system-of-record for online process data. As a result of the project, Vir Biotechnology scientists have moved from using remote desktop software for monitoring multiple bioreactors and trending analysis of different reactors individually and performing analytical dashboarding manually in Excel and Tableau, and/or Sharepoint dashboards. In the future, Vir Biotechnology aims to leverage its capacity for REST API data egress externally with CDMO and CRO strategic partners using PowerBI Connector and GraphQL.
