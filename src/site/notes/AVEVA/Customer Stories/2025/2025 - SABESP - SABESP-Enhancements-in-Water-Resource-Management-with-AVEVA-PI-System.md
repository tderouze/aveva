## Description
Description: "This project presents the modernization of the PI System environment at SABESP, focusing on server virtualization and the updating of essential components. Through a robust and distributed architecture, significant improvements were implemented, including the migration of a legacy application to modern technologies, forecasting water consumption at pumping stations, and real-time monitoring of Water Pumping Stations. The project resulted in reduced operational costs, increased efficiency, and improved service quality for the population. The integration of systems and the adoption of a data-driven approach for decision-making ensured more efficient management of water resources, minimizing water scarcity in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (RMSP). This initiative highlights the potential for innovation and the possibility of replication in other organizations within the sector."
