## Description
Description: "Abstract Description:

The Jal Jeevan Mission, a flagship initiative by the Government of India, aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water to every rural household through individual household tap connections. In Maharashtra, the project is managed by the Maharashtra Jal Pradhikaran (MJP) and covers around 45,000 villages and cities, serving a total population of 112 million.

The primary objectives of the Jal Jeevan Mission are:

1)    Adequate Quantity: Ensuring a water supply of 55 liters per capita per day.

2)    Regular and Safe Water Supply: Guaranteeing regularity and safety in the water supply.

3)    Inclusivity: Including all populations in the supply chain.

4)    Quality and Affordability: Meeting the BIS10500 standards at minimal costs.

5)    Sustainability: Utilizing technology to ensure sustainability across the entire supply chain.

State Water and Sanitation Mission (SWSM) has implemented a state-of-the-art IoT platform for real-time monitoring and management, which is 1st and largest water utility project in India for JJM projects in India. By integrating AVEVA PI System and ESRI Arc GIS, Maharashtra aims to monitor, manage, and optimize water supply across the state effectively.

Challenges:

Ensuring Quality Water to Each Household:
Delivering clean and safe drinking water consistently to every household is critical. Variability in water quality due to contamination and infrastructure issues poses significant challenges.
Certainty of Water Supply:
Ensuring a consistent and reliable water supply to all households requires robust monitoring and management systems to address supply interruptions and distribution inefficiencies.
Non-Revenue Water (Water Leakage Identification):
Water loss due to leaks, theft, or metering inaccuracies leads to significant non-revenue water, impacting the overall efficiency and sustainability of water supply systems.
Water Reservoir Level Measurement:
Accurate monitoring of reservoir levels is essential to manage water resources effectively, plan for droughts, and ensure an uninterrupted supply.
Water Pressure at Critical Points:
Maintaining optimal water pressure at critical points in the distribution network is necessary to prevent infrastructure damage, ensure equitable distribution, and avoid water wastage.
 

Solution and Implementation:

Maharashtra's Jal Jeevan Mission has adopted an integrated approach utilizing AVEVA PI System and ESRI Arc GIS to address these challenges. This integration enables real-time data acquisition, visualization, and analytics to monitor and manage water supply systems efficiently.

Quality Water to Each Household:
By integrating water quality sensors with the PI System, real-time data on water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, and microbial content are monitored. ESRI's GIS platform maps this data, allowing for the identification of contamination sources and timely interventions to ensure safe drinking water.
Certainty of Water Supply:
The PI System collects data from flow meters and distribution points, providing insights into water availability and distribution patterns. ESRI's spatial analysis tools help visualize supply routes and identify areas with inconsistent supply, facilitating targeted corrective actions.
Non-Revenue Water (Water Leakage Identification):
The integration allows for the continuous monitoring of the distribution network, identifying anomalies indicative of leaks or unauthorized usage. Predictive analytics in the PI System help detect potential leakages, while ESRI maps these hotspots for efficient field interventions.
Water Reservoir Level Measurement:
Reservoir levels are monitored using sensors connected to the PI System, providing real-time data on water storage. ESRI's visualization tools help in planning and managing water resources, ensuring reservoirs are maintained at optimal levels.
Water Pressure at Critical Points:
Pressure sensors integrated with the PI System provide continuous data on water pressure throughout the distribution network. ESRI's mapping tools identify critical points with pressure variations, enabling proactive measures to maintain consistent pressure and prevent pipe bursts.
Benefits:

Improved Water Quality:
Real-time monitoring and quick response to contamination ensure the supply of safe and clean drinking water to all households.
Reliable Water Supply:
Continuous monitoring and data-driven decision-making enhance the reliability and consistency of water supply across cities and villages.
Reduced Water Loss:
Early detection and localization of leaks through integrated systems significantly reduce non-revenue water, improving the efficiency of the water supply network.
Effective Resource Management:
Accurate reservoir level monitoring aids in optimal water resource management, ensuring preparedness for varying demand and drought conditions.
Maintained Water Pressure:
Consistent water pressure at critical points prevents infrastructure damage, ensures equitable distribution, and minimizes water wastage.
 

Conclusion: 

The implementation of advanced water management technologies using AVEVA PI System has led to significant improvements in several key areas. Real-time monitoring and rapid response systems ensure the consistent supply of safe and clean drinking water to every household. Continuous data analysis aids in maintaining a reliable and steady water supply across urban and rural regions. The integration of leak detection systems allows for the early identification and repair of leaks, drastically reducing water loss and enhancing the overall efficiency of the water distribution network. Moreover, accurate monitoring of reservoir levels facilitates effective water resource management, ensuring readiness for fluctuations in demand and periods of drought. Consistent water pressure is maintained at critical points, preventing infrastructure damage, ensuring fair distribution, and minimizing wastage."
