### Eli Lilly: Innovative Environmental Monitoring: Scalable Solutions with PI System and Remote I/O

Use Case: Monitoring Solution Eli Lilly and Company has implemented an innovative approach to Qualified Building Management System \[QBMS\] monitoring, transforming how critical environmental conditions are monitored in manufacturing rooms. Traditionally, such monitoring relied on a comprehensive SCADA system \[DeltaV\] or PLC-based solutions, which involved significant complexity and rising costs, particularly in the post-pandemic era with increases in automation component expenses \[I/O, CHARMs, controllers, etc.\]. To address these challenges, Lilly expanded on a lab-scale monitoring solution, scaling it into a robust site-wide environmental monitoring system using the PI System integrated with remote Turck I/O. This presentation will delve into the implementation strategy, execution, and delivery of this solution. Attendees will gain meaningful insights into how this approach has reduced complexity, minimized costs, and provided real-time monitoring capabilities while ensuring compliance with strict environmental standards in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Products: AVEVA PI System 2018 SP6 \[AF, Notifications, DA, Vision\],PI Interfaces for OPC DA, PI Adapters for Modbus TCP \[Lab Environment\], PI OLEDB for SQL for Reporting Benefits: Cost Reduction, Efficiency, and Scalability
