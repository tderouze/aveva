Description: "Avista, an electric and gas utility in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, will present on utility wildfire prevention. The presentation will discuss how leveraging AVEVA PI System has enabled Avista to be more aware of the ever-changing fire risks in its service territory, from a high-level overview down to the detail of individual feeders. The presentation will include how AVEVA PI System enables Avista to look back at how the fire risk forecast metrics change over time. Avista will supplement this presentation with a brief overview of how the data import process is monitored, given that acting on up-to-date data is critically important for safety and efficiency."
