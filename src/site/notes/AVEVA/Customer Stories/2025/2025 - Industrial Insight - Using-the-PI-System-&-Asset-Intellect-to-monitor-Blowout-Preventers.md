## Description
Description: "Industrial Insight and Subsea Solutions from Houston, TX worked on a blowout preventer monitoring solution for Subsea's customers. The first layer was creating a PI System in Azure with a custom Kongsberg WITSML interface to get the data from the rig. An AF model that essentially will build itself for additional rigs was then built using AF templates with proper substitution parameters.

PI Vision displays were built for near real-time monitoring. Then, Dimension Software's Asset Intellect was used to capture notes, pictures, and screenshots for incident reporting. Finally, Dimension's Alarm Sentinel was used to monitor and filter all of the alarms from the rig, along with tracking the actions taken on the alarms."
