### Methanex: Unlocking AI’s Potential with PI System Data & CONNECT: A Simplified, Scalable Approach

We use AVEVA PI System as our standard historian, capturing vast amounts of operational data across six countries to drive plant efficiency. Our goal is to integrate this data with foundational AI models hosted on Azure AI and models developed using Python; and generate executive reports via Power BI. The main challenge lies in securely extracting AVEVA PI System data from DMZs, made more complex by our global footprint. Existing solutions like PI Integrator and PI Web API require significant infrastructure, deep technical knowledge and lack a central data-sharing hub, making them non-scalable solutions. CONNECT addresses these issues by providing a lightweight, web-services-based platform for secure data transfer. This streamlined approach reduces integration costs and complexity, enabling rapid deployment of AI models and delivering real-time insights to leadership. As a result, we have accelerated data-driven decision-making and realized tangible benefits in plant performance.
