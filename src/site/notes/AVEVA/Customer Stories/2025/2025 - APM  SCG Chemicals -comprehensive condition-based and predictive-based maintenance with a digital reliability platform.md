### APM | SCG Chemicals: comprehensive condition-based and predictive-based maintenance with a digital reliability platform

Managing asset health effectively is challenging when data is fragmented and teams work in silos, leading to delayed maintenance, unplanned downtime, and costly inefficiencies. Discover how SCG Chemicals, in collaboration with REPCO NEX, an AVEVA Technology Partner in Thailand, addresses these challenges with a centralized digital reliability platform. This platform seamlessly integrates data from AVEVA applications and health-related sources like AVEVA PI System, AVEVA Predictive Analytics, and AVEVA Mobile Operator. By combining condition-based and predictive maintenance with Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), the platform proactively detects and prevents failures, enhancing reliability and minimizing downtime. Join us to learn how SCG Chemicals delivers smarter maintenance strategies for sustainable operations through end-to-end reliability management.
