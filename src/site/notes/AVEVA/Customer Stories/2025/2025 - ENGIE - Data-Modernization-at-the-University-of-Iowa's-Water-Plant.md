## Description
Description: "Until recently, the Water Plant at the University of Iowa stored our lab data in an aging Microsoft Access database from the 1990s. This database had numerous problems and limitations: data was not easy to use, users were unable to edit the structure to accomidate changing needs, incorrect labeling of some samples, samples that were unable to be recorded accuratly due to constraints, calculated fields were calculated incorrectly, and so on. This program was used to calculate our CT values (an equation which tells us if we have properly disinfected of the water), which caused reporting issues as well. 

As ENGIE has been pushing to digitize and modernize our data collection and retention we have taken many steps to improve the processes. Updatable bench sheets were developed, data was generated digitally to minimize printing and paper use, a digital shift exchange log was built, and, most importantly, a new laboratory information management system was sought out. First we explored licensing a water specific laboratory information management system but, due to the cost, we had to find other options. Both ENGIE and the University of Iowa have utilized AVEVA's PI System for quite a while and there is a local team dedicated to its support, so the water plant group and the PI team worked together to develop a PI-based system to manage laboratory results. 

We now use PI Manual Logger to enter our sample results, PI Vision to view and share the results, and PI DataLink to enter any of the results into Excel spreadsheets to generate reports. Many calculations can now be ran such as CT values, the Langelier Saturation Index, water storage totals, and hydroxide alkalinity through the PI System utilizing both current operating conditions and recent sample results. Daily water and chemical usage reports, as well as generation of the Monthly Operations Report, is in the works currently."
