## 2025 - AVEVA World - San Francisco - AVEVA PI System

### Hindustan Zinc: Transforming operational efficiency, asset management, and dispatch planning

Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL) is a leading Indian integrated mining and resources producer of zinc, lead, and silver. It is a subsidiary of Vedanta Limited and operates the world's second-largest zinc mine, with a focus on sustainable mining practices and technological innovation. HZL's operations span multiple mines and smelting facilities, contributing significantly to India's metal industry while prioritizing environmental stewardship and community development. Vedanta Hindustan Zinc Limited, spearheaded the integration of AVEVA PI System with a diverse array of data sources, including ABB, Epiroc, Cisco, Rockwell, Yokogawa, Honeywell, etc. This intricate project required expertise in handling various data communication protocols: OPC DA/UA for DCS/PLC, Modbus for SCADA, APIs for cloud-based databases and IoT gateways, SQL databases for LIMS and telemetry data, and manual data entry via data loggers. Via this solution we improved the reliability health index and performance monitoring of critical assets, OEE, material dispatch planning, mobile equipment OEE, and particle-size prediction in mills. These use cases have helped us improve the operational efficiency of the plant and generating enormous amount of tangible and intangible ROI.
