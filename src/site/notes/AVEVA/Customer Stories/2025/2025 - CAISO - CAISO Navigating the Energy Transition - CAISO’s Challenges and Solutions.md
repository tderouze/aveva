As the energy landscape rapidly evolves, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) plays a pivotal role in ensuring a reliable and efficient transition to a cleaner, more sustainable grid. This presentation examines the key challenges CAISO faces, including the integration of rapidly expanding renewable energy, maintaining grid reliability amid increasing electrification, and managing market complexities driven by Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). It also explores innovative solutions such as advanced forecasting, energy storage optimization, and enhanced market operations designed to sustain grid stability and efficiency in this dynamic environment.
