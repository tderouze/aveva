### Dr. Reddy's Labs' journey with Industry 4.0, World Economic Forum, and Global Lighthouse Network

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (Dr. Reddy's) has been investing in various OT technologies - and in 2022, the World Economic Forum (WEF) recognized our Bachupally, Hyderabad site as part of the Global Lighthouse Network (GLN). Project ‘OpsNext’ was initiated in 2020 to transform the plant into an Industry 4.0 (I4) driven WEF ‘Lighthouse’ factory. We have partnered with Capgemini to scale and roll-out several successful PI based initiatives and OT projects such as consolidation/validation of the PI infrastructure, PI integration with Werum/PAS-X MES, and others. Batch Release via expedited Review by Exception has led to a 20% reduction in turnaround time. PI integration with Honeywell BMS/EMS has resulted in a 10% reduction in energy usage by identifying/isolating unused clean rooms. Real time OEE tracking and proactive CPP (critical process parameters) monitoring (golden tunnel) has led to a significant dip in quality deviations. Join us as we share the learnings from these and other digital transformation initiatives and I4/WEF at Dr. Reddy's.
