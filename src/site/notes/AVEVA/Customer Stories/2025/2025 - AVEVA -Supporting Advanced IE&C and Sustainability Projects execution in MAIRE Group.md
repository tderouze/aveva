### AVEVA: Supporting Advanced IE&C and Sustainability Projects execution in MAIRE Group

MAIRE's journey with AVEVA started in 2018 with a flexible approach aimed at maximizing benefits for the various companies within the Group, including those in the Integrated Engineering & Construction business unit (Tecnimont and KT) and the Sustainable Technology Solutions business unit (Nextchem). In this presentation, we will show how, since 2018, Tecnimont has been utilizing AVEVA – particularly AVEVA Engineering and AVEVA E3D – across various EPC projects. This continued adoption has demonstrated the software’s flexibility and adaptability throughout different project phases and with different clients. Initially, Tecnimont leveraged AVEVA Engineering to streamline the preparation of engineering documentation, using it as a real design collaboration platform. KT's biggest challenge in 2024 has been the full adoption of AVEVA software engineering applications guaranteeing their interoperability in the EPC projects they manage. This implementation was particularly noteworthy as it not only optimized operations but also transformed data representation and sharing, shifting from traditional methods to cloud-based collaboration platforms in alignment with global standards. In addition, Nextchem has recently integrated AVEVA process simulation tools into its complex green hydrogen innovative engineering projects, making AVEVA a real partner in realizing our vision for Energy Transition. In summary, the flexible strategy for adopting AVEVA tools across various MAIRE Group companies and projects underscores the growing importance of efficient data management and collaboration in the engineering sector. These advancements are paving the way for more streamlined and standardized workflows, ultimately contributing to the success of complex engineering projects on a global scale.
