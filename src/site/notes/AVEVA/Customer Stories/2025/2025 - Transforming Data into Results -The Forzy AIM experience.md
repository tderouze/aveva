### Transforming Data into Results: The Forzy AIM experience

Promon Engenharia faced challenges in integrating and centralizing vast volumes of engineering and operational data from multiple systems and disparate sources. This required accuracy, efficiency, and robust technical management. Leveraging its expertise with AVEVA tools, Forzy implemented AVEVA AIM as a unified hub that consolidated critical engineering information, standardized data from various sources, and optimized processes. Customized for all teams (including contractors and suppliers) AIM ensured access to a centralized, reliable repository. Enhancing collaboration and decision-making, the solution provided a clear view of projects and assets. Supported by complementary technologies offering enhanced scalability and flexibility, Forzy bolstered its digital twin and operational intelligence strategy. Consequently, a roadmap was created to integrate real-time data with field systems such as the PI System, enabling Forzy to further optimize maintenance and perform advanced analytics, ensuring better asset performance and reliability in the future.
