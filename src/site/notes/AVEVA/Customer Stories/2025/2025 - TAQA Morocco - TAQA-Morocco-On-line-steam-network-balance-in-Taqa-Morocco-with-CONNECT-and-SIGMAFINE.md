## Description
Description: "TAQA Morocco has already implemented an AVEVA PI System infrastructure feeding the TAQA e-Monitoring Center for the six power generation units of Jorf Lasfar power plant. A proof of concept has been launched, joining CONNECT technology and Pimsoft Sigmafine to create a cloud based solution providing an on-line monitoring of the energy distribution of the steam network of one coal fired unit of 312 MW net, providing accurate KPIs and insights for non-measured streams, both accessible to all organization and on a secured infrastructure."
