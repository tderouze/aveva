## Description
Description: "F. Hoffmann-La Roche, one of the world's largest pharmaceuticals companies, recently partnered with AVEVA and Capgemini to develop a reliable, cloud-based data platform to enable advanced analytics use cases and drive scalability. 

Faced with a complex server landscape and high costs in a commercial data lake, Roche turned to CONNECT data services to efficiently aggregate and contextualize data from numerous on-premises systems and simplify data pipelines to analytics tools such as AVEVA Advanced Analytics, Seeq and Dataiku.  With a simplified infrastructure, Roche was able to quickly enable use cases such as centrifuge maintenance, process monitoring and more - and accelerate time-to-value for future data projects.

In this session, you will hear about Roche's project approach and technical solution architecture, as well as lessons learned and best practices that allowed Roche to demonstrate ROI from CONNECT in less than 3 months."
