## Description
Description: "The team behind MOL Petrochemicals' Poliol production needed the capability to monitor batch production. They were already reporting but using ad-hoc, manually created reports in Excel and manually created PI Vision displays for each batch product.  This generated high workload and it was difficult to maintain displays with multiple recipe versions, neither of which were sustainable. Join this presentation to find out how they combatted their batch tracking challenge by using AVEVA PI System asset framework and AVEVA PI Vision."
