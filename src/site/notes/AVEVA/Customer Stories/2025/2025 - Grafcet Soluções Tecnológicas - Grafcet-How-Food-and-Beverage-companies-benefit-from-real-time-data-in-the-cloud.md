## Description
Description: "The use of data has become a crucial factor for industries, and this is no different for the food and beverage sector, particularly for orange juice producers. Strategic and operational decisions increasingly depend on the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, which provides valuable insights to optimize processes and improve product quality. Collecting and analyzing operational data is essential to optimizing orange juice production. By monitoring each stage of the production process — such as the quantity of oranges processed, the yield of juice extracted, and the processing time — it is possible to identify bottlenecks, which allows adjustments to be made in real time. Data on the performance of equipment, such as extractors, filters and pasteurizers, allows maintenance to be predicted and unexpected failures to be avoided, ensuring production continuity.

The project requirements were to integrate the value chain processes, including the agricultural, industrial and logistics phases via a centralized environment to correlate their process data, which would allow them to analyze historical data as well as in real time. The implementation of the project required approximately four months, half of which was used to contextualize plant data, due to the volume of data to be contextualized and correlated to the assets created, and two months to create and correct screens according to the client's requirements. The solution included CONNECT Data Services, CONNECT Visualization, AVEVA System Platform, and AVEVA Historian."
