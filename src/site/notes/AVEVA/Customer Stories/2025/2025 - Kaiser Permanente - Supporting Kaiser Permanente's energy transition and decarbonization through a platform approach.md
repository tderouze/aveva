## Summary
**1. Challenges**  
- Managing a complex portfolio of distributed energy resources (DERs) across 650+ sites with limited staff, disparate monitoring systems, and varied ownership structures (PPAs, KP-owned).  
- Inefficiencies like oversized fuel cells causing excess net metering losses, inconsistent solar PPA performance, and high demand charges due to unoptimized energy use.  
- Difficulty tracking Scope 1 (natural gas) and Scope 2 (electricity) emissions amid climate goals.  

**2. Solution**  
- **DERNetSoft’s centralized platform** integrated data from DERs, utilities, and vendors, enabling real-time analytics, automated alerts, and performance tracking.  
- Implemented actionable insights: downsized/reallocated fuel cells, optimized solar tariffs, nighttime energy setbacks, and demand charge management.  
- Scalable framework for future initiatives (e.g., EV charging) and integration with broader healthcare energy ecosystems.  

**3. Benefits**  
- **Cost savings**: $3M/year from solar audits, $1.4M/year from nighttime setbacks, and millions in fuel cell refunds.  
- **Sustainability**: Reduced Scope 1/2 emissions via gas/electricity curtailment and DER optimization.  
- **Operational efficiency**: Streamlined DER management, data-driven decision-making, and improved resilience across 70M+ sq. ft. of facilities.

### Supporting Kaiser Permanente's energy transition and decarbonization through a platform approach

Presentation Title: Supporting Kaiser Permanente's energy transition and decarbonization through energy efficiency, visibility, and optimization maximizing financials benefits. Kaiser Permanente is one of the largest healthcare providers in the US, with more than 1,000 hospitals, medical office buildings, data centers and administrative spaces totaling 80 million square feet. The organization has made aggressive commitments to reduce all emissions (Scope 1-3) by 50% by 2030. KP is already carbon neutral for Scope 1&2, but this requires the purchase of carbon offsets for Scope1 and some renewable energy credits for Scope 2. Thus, KP is constantly seeking ways to minimize any on-site energy usage. One of the key tools in the KP toolkit is the DERNetSoft platform, Software As A Service built on top of AVEVA CONNECT, which enables KP to track electricity and gas usage across hundreds of buildings. This tool greatly augments the abilities of KP’s energy team, which has only four people but is responsible for an energy footprint equivalent to a small city. The platform manages numerous use cases, including tracking when gas usage is excessively high at night and on weekends. Again, gas consumption – a Scope 1 emission – is very hard to reduce across the board. The platform can quickly scan for opportunities for on-site solar and battery storage as well as optimize the production of existing DERs. On the Scope 3 side, KP can now track employee and member EV usage across 1,500 charging stations located on KP properties. Combined with all of KP’s other sustainability initiatives, the DERNetSoft intelligence provides the organization with a much clearer line of sight as it relates to achieving the 2030 targets.

Seth Baruch

Seth Baruch is National Director for Energy and Utilities and is responsible for KP's on-site and off-site renewable energy programs. KP’s renewable program is installing more than 100 MW of solar generation at hospitals and medical office buildings throughout California. In addition, Kaiser Permanente is contracting to buy the energy output of more than 330 MW of off-site wind and solar projects in and around California. These initiatives are a large part of KP’s overall strategy to get to carbon neutrality, which was achieved in 2020. Seth also manages the fuel cell program (35 MW) as well as the battery storage and EV charger programs. KP currently has more than 1,300 EV chargers on its properties. He also raised the funding for – and helped implement – a microgrid installation at the Richmond Medical Center, the first renewable microgrid in the State of California. A second microgrid project at the Ontario Medical Center is currently under construction.
