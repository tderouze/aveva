### Centralized data infrastructure for management of PayPal data center operations

In 2017, PayPal partnered with Casne to design and deploy a robust, independent data infrastructure. PayPal had a data center facility where they were responsible for everything from the power strips to utility and back-up power. Additionally, PayPal was a tenant in colocation facilities in the United States and Europe. PayPal had multiple disparate systems for visualization and alerts, and needed more accurate real-time data from the power-strips in all data centers. PayPal looked to Casne to help create a centralized data infrastructure. Casne worked to integrate all data into the PI System for a single pane of glass experience.
