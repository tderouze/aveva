Learn how Kellogg's was able to use the PI System to build digital twins of all equipment on the packing lines at its Valls manufacturing facilities to improve equipment mean time between failures (MTBF) and reduce the number of minor stops on the line to meet its OEE goal. By using a living digital twin to visualize, understand, diagnose and prescribe corrective actions, the Valls team was able to evolve from a calendar-based maintenance approach to an event-based approach to maximizing reliability and throughput. The migration of 60+ PI ProcessBook displays to PI Vision further improved the visualization of these living digital twins by presenting an intuitive and real-world view of the packaging lines.
