The age of AI implementation has arrived for many industrial sectors. These sectors are engineering clean real-time data pipelines and building operational safeguards. Manufacturing companies will learn the pitfalls to avoid and best practices to apply from Glatfelter s digital transformation journey to AI-Operations (AI-Ops). Glatfelter s presentation is a must for anyone getting started, dabbling in machine learning, or stumbling in scaling up their AI-Ops. The talk will cover PI Core to data transformation, cloud-based architecture implementation within Azure ML and back to the manufacturing plant. The session will present practical industrial realities to consider and lessons learned from Glatfelter s journey to AI-Ops.
