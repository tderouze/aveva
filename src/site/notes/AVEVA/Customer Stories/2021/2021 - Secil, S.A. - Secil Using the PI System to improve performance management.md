### Secil: Using the PI System to improve performance management

The main challenges the Cement Industry is now facing are related to CO2 emissions quota reduction, and a roadmap should be defined and implemented in order to stay competitive with non-European competitors. The industry has made good progress in the past three decades by reducing emissions 15% since 1990, through mitigation measures such as energy efficiency and fossil fuel substitution. This presentation intends to give insights into how Secil takes advantage of the PI System to gather all pertinent data generated in its cement plants, store and transform the data into valuable information to reduce costs and increase performance. A long-term data historization solution with integration capability for different systems and integrated visualization tools was a key milestone on our digital transformation journey, which can support ongoing and future roadmap initiatives.
