### Summary
CEZ Group, a major energy company in Central and Southeastern Europe, uses the PI System to centralize operational data (CUTD project with 16 facilities and 200,000 tags). They've developed solutions like LTOs (Long Term Operation suite), PowerOPTI, Valves Diagnostics, Vibro Diagnostics, and Energy Balances. A key project is Condition Based Monitoring (CBM) aimed at extending asset life by leveraging existing data. This involves online and offline monitoring, alarm settings based on statistical distributions, correlation and cluster analysis to refine alarm accuracy, and applications to boiler pressure parts, rotating machines, and transformers. The LTO suite integrates equipment data for condition evaluation, safe life extension, and improved maintenance planning. The goal is to improve technical safety, reduce outages, and enhance predictive maintenance.
