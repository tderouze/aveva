## Description
We'll talk about Tereos, the business challenge, the transformation journey, the current system structure, use cases and how the PI System is being used, and implementation details. The current structure with centralized data is allowing Tereos to build optimization tools, data visualizations and simulations, digital twins, real-time optimizers and a maintenance monitoring center. The idea is to show how the PI System has been the secret ingredient to speed up industrial operations. Case 1: Integrated process view: Data visualization from top management to the shop floor. Case 2: Alexa Virtual assistant integrated with the PI System Case 3: Asset management enabling increased reliability. Case 4: Notifications via Telegram
