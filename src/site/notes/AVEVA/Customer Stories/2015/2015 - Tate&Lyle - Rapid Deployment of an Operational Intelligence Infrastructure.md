## Description
Tate & Lyle is a specialty food and bulk ingredients producer founded in the UK. 
Tate & Lyle standardized on the PI System in 2000: The PI System consisted of 19 historian servers at 16 sites. Each site has a local PI Administrator, but in the past, little central oversight. 486,000 licensed tags, 57 interfaces, Centralized PI Server in Decatur, IL, Centralized PI Server in London, UK. All servers running pre-PI Server 2010. Primary tools in use were PI ProcessBook and PI DataLink 
Operations heavily relied on the PI System as a decision driver

To prove the value of the PI System, T&L stood up a POC/Dev environment where they could test the latest versions of the PI System tools without impacting their Production environment.  They were given a two week deadline to find and demonstrate as much savings as possible. A goal of a 5% increase in batch production was set. 

Questions they wanted to answer:
- Where is the process spending time? 
- How can I monitor key metrics? 
- Where are the downtimes? 
- What is the OEE? 
- How can I track energy? 
- How can I improve throughput? 
- Show me – by product, by process cycle, by day… 
- Can the new tools bring any insight into my process?


Obstacle:  Problems with the control systems and existing Batch interface configuration made it very difficult to collect and use the Batch process data.
   Climax:  Seeing the batches consistently built using the expected structure and then using this data as a source for Analytics, BI and Notifications
   Results:  Within two week so of standing up the POC/Dev environment, T&L realized a 7% Batch production gain - exceeding their estimate
 Benefits:  1) Batch data collection and configuration in a consistent manner;
                  2) Server-side reports, KPIs and notifications pushing the data to the employees
                  3) Bringing Quality data into the PI System allowed analysis of both data side-by-side
                  4) Insight provided by the data will lead to additional optimization and savings
                  5) This POC was performed at one site; the project will be expanded 

Within 2 weeks of presenting the data to operations:
Production increased by 7%, by refocusing on the PI System data analysis, surpassing our original target of a 5% increase. 
They were able to calculate the additional energy needed for the production increase and verify there were no constraints 
Downtime is automatically calculated 
Critical KPI’s are received in daily emails 
The increase was achieved with no additional equipment or capital expenditure 
Calculated revenue increase between $300,000 and $500,000 annually – We have 15 of these units across the company!

-------------------------------------------------------

Challenge:
- Disparate control systems and interface configuration made it difficult to interpret batch process data

Solution:
- Deployed a POC system to analyze process parameters across batches, shifting operations management from configuring data and making calculations to analyze data for operational insights

Benefits:
- Realized a 7% batch production increase within the first two weeks
- Calculated site revenue increase between $300-500k annually
- Production increase was achieved with no new equipment or capital expenditure
