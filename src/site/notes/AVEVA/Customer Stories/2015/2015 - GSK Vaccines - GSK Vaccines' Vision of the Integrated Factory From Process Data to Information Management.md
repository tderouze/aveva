### GSK Vaccines' Vision of the Integrated Factory: From Process Data to Information Management

The Siena-Rosia vaccines manufacturing plant is one of the key sites of Bacterial Vaccines production that integrates the whole process from research to packaging and distribution. As a strategic site with a large number of complex productive processes assisted by computerized and automated systems the priority of a systematic and robust control approach and the value of the data have grown to the top level. The risk to create a maze of data that does not bring any information to the user is really high, if all these data are not properly managed and correlated. From here starts the need to create a routing path for the information and to protect the user by providing only the necessary data, and by offering a user friendly system able to bring directly to him only all the information useful at that time, enabling him to take the right decision.

This journey started with harmonizing control systems to standard control platforms (Emerson DeltaV). OSIsoft's PI System data infrastructure is also a key building block for data and information management across the process. At various layers, OSIsoft components are used to deliver the required information. PI ProcessBook displays and PI Datalink reports are used on the shop floor to assist the plant operator/supervisor in keeping the process under control, and by process engineers and quality specialists to analyze the data to improve the process or investigate deviations.

Official process reports are generated via RtReports which is accessible through a web interface to all those involved in the batch release process. It collects all the necessary information into a single paperless attachment for the batch production report."
