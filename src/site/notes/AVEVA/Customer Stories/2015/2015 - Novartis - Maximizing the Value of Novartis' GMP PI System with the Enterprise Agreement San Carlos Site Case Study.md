*PI Coresight was renamed PI Vision in 2017*

This presentation will discuss how the Novartis site in San Carlos, CA leveraged OSIsoft's Enterprise Agreement to upgrade and improve their GMP PI System. San Carlos is the first Novartis site to implement the new standard architecture. Noteworthy successes include remote software installation with OSIsoft Field Service Engineers, implementation of Managed PI, and the use of PI Coresight (desktop and iphone app) to monitor manufacturing activities.
