#### PRESENTATION

## 2015 - Midstream Oil and Gas Industry Forum - Paris

### Satisfying Demand Fluctuations with Minimum Operational Expenditures

The line pack is the total quantity of natural gas in the pipeline at any time. The compressibility of natural gas allows the use of line pack to compensate for fluctuation of gas demand. Using linear programming models, GRTgaz optimizes its line pack, satisfying the demand fluctuation with minimum operational expenditures. This talk will show how the PI System helped GRTgaz apply a new real-time line pack calculation method.
