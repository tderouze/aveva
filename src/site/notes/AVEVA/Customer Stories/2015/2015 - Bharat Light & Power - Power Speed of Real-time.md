### Summary
Bharat Light & Power (BLP) presentation in 2015, detailing how they leverage OSIsoft's PI System and their own Orion platform to address challenges in renewable energy operations and maintenance (O&M). They faced issues like OEM dependency, weather impact, lack of transparency, and real-time visibility, leading to revenue losses. BLP implemented Orion, providing 24/7 monitoring, predictive intelligence, and integration with other systems. This, combined with OSIsoft's PI System for real-time monitoring, enabled proactive maintenance, reduced downtime, and significantly decreased revenue loss from equipment failures.

#### Challenges
O&M Challenges: Dependency on OEM, Weather conditions, Insufficient Contract Obligations, Lack of Transparency, Limited Accessibility, Lack of situational awareness, Lack of real time visibility and predictive intelligence.

#### Solution
Orion: 24*7 Active Monitoring, Alerts & Watch list management, Predictive Intelligence, Rule Engines, Weather modeling, Future Data, Asset performance report (MIS), Generation tracking against Targets, Integrated with ERP, Performance Management, Documents Mgt. PI System for Real time monitoring in the Renewable Operations Center (ROC)

#### Benefits
Gearbox failure predicted, Turbine made available for 2 peak wind months, Annual revenue loss reduced to 20 %, Reactive to Proactive, 40 % Revenue saving with 1 prediction

## Description
In this day and age, the renewable industry is bogged down by huge failure rates. Statistics say that approximately 75% of faults cause 5% of downtime and 25% of faults cause 95% of downtime so increasing operational efficiency is vitally needed. There is also a need for the industry to proactively rely more on performance optimization of all operational assets rather than being reactive. BLP's idea is to overcome these issues by leveraging advanced technologies. In this regard, BLP has created a robust IT platform, which is highly secure and scalable, by leveraging advanced capabilities of OSIsoft and IBM to effectively manage day to day operations of the existing fleet. BLP's deep domain expertise, analytics capabilities, and robust infrastructure have not only helped maintain asset uptime but has significantly increased overall asset efficiency. BLP manages the entire operation through a suite of applications which include monitoring, reporting, data analytics, power forecasting, field ops, etc.
