## Description
In North America, Southwest Power Pool (SPP) is one of nine Independent System Operators/Regional Transmission Organizations (ISOs/RTOs) and one of eight NERC Regional Entities. SPP is mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure reliable supplies of power, adequate transmission infrastructure, and competitive wholesale prices of electricity. ISOs/RTOs are the ""air traffic controllers"" of the electric power grid. ISOs/RTOs do not own the power grid but they independently operate the grid minute-by-minute to ensure that power gets to customers and to eliminate power shortages. The Integrated Marketplace is the latest and most complex incremental step in SPP's evolutionary approach to adding market functionality that coordinates next-day generation across the region to maximize cost-effectiveness, provide participants with greater access to reserve energy, improve regional balancing of electricity supply and demand, and facilitate the integration of renewable resources.

SPP has the need to record over a million streaming points with reasonably fast (4 sec) update times, perform calculations, and have make it possible for users to locate the data they need. The PI System was chosen as the data infrastructure to group and locate data. PI Asset Framework (PI AF) is used to consolidate information from multiple systems including: Energy Management System (EMS), Markets, Outage Data, and Forecast Data. However, with such a large model, over 150,000 PI AF Elements, the challenge was to create robust templates and hierarchy while automating processes to generate the model.

When building large PI AF models, it is critical to have modeling tools available that can reduce the workload on staff. This presentation will focus on a custom modeling solution built by SPP that utilizes PI System Explorer plug-ins and we will also cover how the PI AF model has added to our benefits from the PI System."
