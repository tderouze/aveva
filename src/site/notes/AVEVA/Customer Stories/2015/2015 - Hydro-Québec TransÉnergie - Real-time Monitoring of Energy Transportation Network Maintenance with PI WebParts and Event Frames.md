### Summary
Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie implemented a real-time monitoring solution using AVEVA (OSIsoft PI System) to improve maintenance and operational efficiency. The project involved integrating data from over 530 substations, monitoring strategic transformers, and tracking electrical events. Key components included SharePoint, PI WebParts, Event Frames, and PI Analysis Services. The solution enabled engineers to access data anywhere, receive timely notifications, and build their own web pages. They focused on rigorous naming conventions, maximizing AF templates, minimizing programming, and migrating from PI-ACE to PI Analysis Services. The results included faster access to data, reduced investigation time, improved equipment availability, and lower IT costs.

#### Challenges
Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie needed to promptly notify engineers of important electrical events, provide secure web access to data for 400 users across multiple platforms while respecting NERC standards, empower engineers to build their own web pages, and implement an evolutive solution adaptable to business changes with minimal IT involvement. They also faced challenges with existing PI-ACE calculations, performance equation integrations, and limitations with PI Notifications.

#### Solution
Implemented MS SharePoint 2010 with PI WebParts, developed AF templates, created PowerShell scripts for event frame capture, transferred ACE calculations to PI Analysis Services, maximized use of PI WebParts services, and used PI-OLEDB (planned migration to PI Web Services). They trapped electrical events using PowerShell scripts to transfer IED event files to Event Frames. They also utilized PI Notifications, addressing its limitations with workarounds and custom scripts.

#### Benefits
Improved equipment availability, reduced the impact of abnormal transformer heating, enhanced follow-up after repairs, and ensured sensor reliability. It also significantly reduced investigation time from days to near real-time, improved maintenance department autonomy, and lowered TCO compared to Citrix PI ProcessBook & PI DataLink distribution. The transition enabled a switch from systematic to condition-based maintenance, extending equipment life expectancy.

## Description
Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie owns one of the largest transportation network in the world. This Hydro-Québec division maintains 34,187 km of high voltage electrical transportation lines (with voltage up to 735 KV) connecting production/distribution facilities through 530 substations. A vast data acquisition equipment implementation project has been underway since 2010 to acquire equipment and lines maintenance data. This data is stored in a 250,000 tag PI Server with several calculations, notifications, displays, and reports managed thru the PI System. Recently, PI Event Frames has been leveraged to catch electrical events on high voltage protection and to analyze and notify maintenance engineers about events. A maintenance SharePoint site which uses PI WebParts was also built with shortcuts to data analysis displays that included in emailed notifications. This approach has substantially reduced response time to electrical incident events in our substations. The combination of Event Frame, fast notifications, and continual access to easy to use, informative, displays for our specialists are key benefits of the PI System technology. The presentation will describe our approach, how PI System technology is being used, and presenting our benefits and future development plans.
