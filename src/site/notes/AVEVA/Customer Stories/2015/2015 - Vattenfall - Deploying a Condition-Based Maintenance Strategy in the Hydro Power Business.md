## Vattenfall's Results

## Screenshots

Vattenfall Hydro Power needed to implement a new strategy for condition-based maintenance and asset management, leading to reduced costs for unplanned maintenance and increased accuracy in asset management risk analysis. The existing IT solution did not provide the necessary functionality for this. After a thorough evaluation project in 2014, Vattenfall is now deploying the PI System as part of its new strategy. Most of the advanced features of the Asset Framework are used for calculations and in displays. PI Manual Logger Web module allows manual rounding and inspection in the hydro power plants with Android tablets.
