### Summary
Shire Pharmaceuticals strategically implemented the AVEVA (OSIsoft PI System) PI System in Process Development (PD) *before* Manufacturing. This allowed them to manage big data, improve technology transfer, increase PD efficiency, and ensure data integrity. Shire recognized that PD is a key data generator and that addressing data management challenges there would benefit the entire process, leading to more robust and seamless technology transfers to Manufacturing. The business case focused on data integrity, security, and accessibility. A phased approach was taken, starting with bioreactor data. The PI System enables scientists to quickly retrieve, compare, and analyze data, facilitating faster insights and better decisions.

## Description
The work product of Process Development (PD) is process knowledge in the form of data. This process knowledge is the foundation of the technology transfer to Manufacturing. Most companies start addressing data management strategy only after Manufacturing is producing product. Manufacturing data strategies typically include the implementation of data historians to monitor data from the plant floor to better regulate and control the process. But why wait until manufacturing has begun?
