## Description
This presentation will explain the expansion from a standalone Energy Monitoring System to a complex and fundamental Engineering Management System for a Pharmaceutical production plant network in Austria. Based on the need for energy transparency and the ISO 50001 requirement, potential monitoring tools on the market were evaluated. OSIsoft’s PI System was selected as a very good business-related solution that allowed easy configuration and was quick to implement. After some early applications, a much larger use of the PI System was identified. The first project involved expanding the Energy Monitoring System to an Engineering Management System referred to as EMAS. EMAS is a monitoring system that considers the complete life cycle of assets - from investment planning, where the resources required are calculated from historical data, to condition monitoring with alarming via early problem detection, to reliability engineering optimization through documented results. It also supports measuring service level agreements and verification of life cycle costs. "
