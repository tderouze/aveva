### Performance Event Logging and Management in an Iron Making Process

In what may be at best described as a challenging and competitive business climate in the steel Industry, performance associated to Key Performance Indicators has become more critical than ever. Essar Steel Algoma Inc. (Algoma) is an integrated steel producer located in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada which began using the PI System and tools several years ago to better manage manufacturing performance. Algoma wanted to build beyond the PI infrastructure adding applications which focused on logging manufacturing performance loss incidents and events including contextual data sets and cause codes.

A Proof of Concept project was initiated and completed with the Ekho Manufacturing Performance Management software supplied by Inexcon Technologies, Inc., an OSIsoft Partner. The Ekho software product was chosen for its transparent integration into the PI infrastructure, iTiâ€™s product development which is closely coupled with PI, and for its flexibility and rapid rollout. This paper will describe the scope and objectives of this project.
