### Smart Monitoring of Cement Plants for Energy Efficiency

CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high quality products and reliable service to customers and communities throughout the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

The company sustainability strategy is to run a highly efficient and profitable business that ensures the safety and well-being of employees, protects the environment, and contributes to the development of communities. Cement Industry is heavy user of electrical and fossil fuels energy. CEMEX developed a smart monitoring platform to optimize total energy consumption, using an OSIsoft enterprise wide real time infrastructure.

This platform allows an easy and standardized KPI metric of energy consumption for main equipments of a cement plant. Using PI ACE calculations and PI MDB to a manageable configuration and deployment for each facility, empowering plant users with detailed online energy consumption performance history so they can assertively manage the energy plant’s demands. This allows:

- Reduction of fossil fuel footprint

- Alignment of smart electrical consumption with electrical company’s policies.

- Reduction of total energy consumption cost

- Reduction of CO2 emissions
