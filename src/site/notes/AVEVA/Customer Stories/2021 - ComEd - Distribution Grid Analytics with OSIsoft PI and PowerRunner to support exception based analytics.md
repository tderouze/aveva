## Description
Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd, an Exelon Company) provides electric service to approximately 3.8M customers across northern Illinois, or 70% of the state s population. Distribution teaming schemes are becoming more advanced and the challenge is how do you monitor team status in near real-time, incorporate design changes, and keep a record of the type of event happening to the team. ComEd is using the PI System with their partner, PowerRunner, to monitor and automate team updates in an automated fashion.
