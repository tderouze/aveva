## Description
Fierce competition is forcing power generators to focus on profitable sales opportunities as well as on the optimal deployment of all production facilities. Flexible, precise and reliable unit control in the generation fleet is a key element. Participating in the control energy market means especially high demands with regard to the timing accuracy and flexibility of information processing and provision at the individual sites and the resource scheduling units. To meet Vattenfall Europe Berlin’s specific requirements, a Dispatch Information System was developed that not only provides all production-relevant data from the 23 units (with different I&C systems), but also quickly and reliably processes and visualizes the target-values specified by resource scheduling in the control rooms. Schedule adherence is also monitored. The presentation includes an overview of the IT system concept. An experience report shows the strengths and weaknesses found.
